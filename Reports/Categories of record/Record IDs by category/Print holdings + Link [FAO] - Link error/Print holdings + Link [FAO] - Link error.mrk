=520  3\$aIt is now widely recognized that the rising demand for aquatic products will have to be met by aquaculture. The future of aquaculture will depend on how well it meets this challenge. The contribution of aquaculture to total fishery products (excluding plants), globally, has steadily increased from 4 percent in 1970 to 36 percent in 2006 and is continuing to increase. The growing importance of aquaculture in overcoming production limits of capture fisheries can be judged from the fact that China's 2004 aquaculture production was about 70 percent of its total fisheries production. By 2020, global aquaculture is expected to contribute about 120-130 million tonnes of fish to meet projected demands .The types of species/species groups dominating fed aquaculture production and the recent focus to increase and intensify production of crustaceans, marine finfish, and diadromous fishes, reflects a tendency to increasing reliance on aquafeeds, for their production, and particularly commercial diets. It is, therefore, crucial that aquaculture is sustainable and that the resources required for promoting aquaculture are secured. Key resources required to meet this challenge are aquafeeds and the ingredients used in their production. These resources, together with high transportation costs as a result of costly energy, form the central part of this study. Fed aquaculture relies on a basket of common input ingredients such as soybean, corn, fishmeal, fish oil, rice and wheat, for which it competes in the marketplace with the animal husbandry sector as well as with use for direct human consumption .Many of these key ingredients traditionally used in recipes for commercial or on-farm aquaculture feeds are internationally traded commodities. Therefore, aquafeed production is also subjected to any common global market shocks and volatility. Since 2005, the basket commodity price index (CPI) rose by about 50 percent and the prices of soybean meal, fishmeal, corn and wheat rose by 67, 55, 284, 225 and 180 percent, respectively. Similarly, the cost of major oils used in the aquafeed industry has increased by up to 250 percent. The aquaculture industry is, therefore, not immune to this global phenomenon and the major concern is how it will impact aquaculture. Specifically, smallholders and rural farmers may particularly be susceptible to these global changes and the fallout may further contribute to their poverty and vulnerability .Considering such developments, this technical review evaluates the underlying reasons for the recent dramatic rise in prices of these commodities used in aquafeed production and its consequences for the aquafeed industry and, in particular, on demand and expectations from aquaculture in securing current and future fish supplies. This technical paper also discusses issues related to availability of and access to land and water resources, and the impact of other sectors using these resources on the direction of aquaculture both in terms of species produced and the production systems. In the light of probable increase in competition for land and water in many aquaculture producing countries in Asia, there will inevitably be increasing pressure to intensify aquaculture productivity through the use of more commercial feeds than farm-made feeds .Urbanization has influenced both the level and distribution of income and dietary habits which are driving upwards the demand for high-value fish species with significant implications for feed supplies. Due to the increasing prices of ingredients, aquafeed prices, especially the prices of compound aquafeeds, may increase further and a shortfall in the local supplies will compel importation of aquafeeds. Of the ingredients, fishmeal and fish oil are highly favoured for aquafeeds and aquafeed production is under increasing pressure due to limited supplies and increasing price of fishmeal and fish oil. This review also outlines initiatives that are searching for substitutes for fishmeal and fish oil so as to position the industry to meet the challenge of securing aquafeed for sustaining aquaculture. To regulate the rising commodity prices would require governmental interventions .A brief overview of coping strategies to strengthen national capacity to address the issue of aquafeed supply and to mitigate rising prices of aquafeed ingredient is given. These strategies include policies, research and private sector and farmers' initiatives.

=520  \\$aThe Workshop attempted to develop an indicator system to measure the contribution of SSA, using a number of processes and steps, including: (i) understanding the subject of measurements; (ii) identifying an analytical framework and setting criteria (iii) developing a list of SSA contributions; (iv) categorizing the contributions; (v) devising and organizing the indicators of contribution; and (vi) measuring the indicators. The major outcome was the development, through an iterative process, of an indicator system which can provide a measure of the contribution of SSA based on agreed criteria (accuracy, measurability and efficiency) and the sustainable livelihood approach analytical framework which consists of five capital assets (human, financial, physical, social and natural) and can be used for various livelihoods options.--Publisher's description.

=520  3\$aThe ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) has been developed during the last decade in response to perceived and actual deficiencies in previous methods of management. The EAF recognizes that fish are only one albeit important part of a much wider ecosystem incorporating an array of physical and biological components that humans interact with and exploit. Rather than managing single fish stocks, an EAF is concerned with the impacts of fisheries on the marine ecosystem, the interactions between different fisheries, of fisheries with the aquaculture sector, as well as with other human activities. The Geographic Information System (GIS) is considered an ideal platform upon which to perform necessary information management and decision-support analysis for the implementation of an EAF. This technical paper is primarily intended to be a guide to methods that readers could adopt for their own use of GIS for an EAF and these methods are covered in some detail .The planning considerations for an appropriate GIS in terms of objectives, scope and geographical area are outlined. The practical considerations are discussed and include hardware architecture, various software possibilities, sources and types of data that will be needed, and the array of backup and support that is available. More specifically, in Section 1 of this paper, the conceptual basis underlying EAF is discussed. In Section 2, a four-step participatory ecosystem management planning and implementation process consistent with EAF is recommended by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and includes: (i) scoping for issues, (ii) setting objectives, (iii) formulating rules and (iv) establishing a monitoring, assessment and review system. In Section 3, the use of GIS is examined beginning with a brief look at its history and development and then reviewing its current application and uses within marine fisheries .In Section 4, the potential use of GIS in a wide range of EAF-related projects is illustrated using examples that focus on mapping, modelling, management and communication. The degree to which GIS is currently being used for EAF implementation is illustrated by four case studies detailed in Section 5. Section 6 proposes a plan for implementation of an EAF using GIS and considers the challenges faced by developing countries in using GIS in fisheries management. Strategies to enhance the role of GIS in EAF are suggested. In conclusion, Section 7 makes recommendations for the adoption of GIS for EAF. The adoption of GIS for an EAF is no easy task and a number of challenges must be faced but GIS for EAF is feasible even in relatively resource-poor situations. The authors hope this paper encourages fishery managers and researchers to explore the many benefits of GIS for managing fisheries in an ecosystem context.

=520  \\$aFire management is an essential part of sustainable forest management. This publication complements the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005 (FRA 2005) as an in-depth thematic study on the incidence, impact and management of forest fires in different regions of the world. It was developed from 12 regional papers prepared within the framework of the Global Wildland Fire Network of the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction. It provides the best estimate of the global fire situation to date and gives a good indication of the scale of the impact of vegetation fires on society, on the economy and on the environment. This global assessment will be of interest not only to fire specialists, but also to policy-makers, forest managers and those involved in collecting reliable and current information on fire in different types of vegetation. It is an important contribution to FAO's efforts to enhance international cooperation in fire management.--Publisher's description.

=520  \\$aConflicts between humans and wildlife have occurred since the dawn of humanity. In Africa, these conflicts have become more frequent and severe over recent decades as a result of human population growth, extension of transport routes and expansion of agricultural and industrial activities which together have led to increased human encroachment on previously wild and uninhabited areas. With a focus on large herbivores and carnivores such as elephant, lions and crocodiles, this book presents the issues, describes different methods of conflict management and outlines a three-step framework for decision making.--Publisher's description.

This publication explores the scope, potential and implications for using woodfuels to replace fossil fuels and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation. It analyses the current woodfuel offset mechanisms in place and their relative emission reduction potentials. The scope is limited to solid woodfuels (fuelwood, charcoal, prepared biomass such as woodchips and pellets, and recovered products or residues from wood processing industries)."--Back cover

=505  2\$aMethodology -- Key data on fish losses -- Loss reduction intervention initiatives -- Additional outputs of the PHLA.
=520  3\$aIn 2006, the Products, Trade and Marketing Service of the Fisheries and Aquaculture Department (formerly the Fish Utilization and Marketing Service) in FAO designed a regional post-harvest loss assessment (PHLA) programme to: [1] develop a core of regional experts in fish loss assessment; [2] generate fish loss data in fisheries of socio-economic importance; [3] produce practical guides for fish loss assessment for extension officers and fishery operators; [4] update the Ward and Jeffries (2000) manual; and [5] provide normative guidance to support the implementation of the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. This regional programme began in October 2006 and lasted 18 months. It aimed to build on past initiatives and develop tools for practical loss assessment in artisanal fisheries. .The programme provided capacity building for fishery officers in qualitative and quantitative fish loss assessments methods, planned support, and supervised the implementation of loss assessment studies in five sub-Saharan African countries (Ghana, Kenya, Mali, United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda). Data were generated on quality and physical losses - the main types of losses identified - and quantified by researchers using three assessment methods. The fieldwork indicates that post-harvest fish losses in small-scale fisheries occur at all stages in the fish supply chain from capture to consumer. Huge physical and quality losses were found to occur in some supply chains assessed in all the countries, with quality losses reported to account for more than 70 percent of total losses. .Concurring data are that physical losses seldom exceed 5 percent in some fisheries, but the findings from assessments of the Lake Victoria sardine (Rastrineobola argentea) fishery indicate much higher losses are occurring during the rainy season when poor drying conditions prevail. Although the nutritional losses and human health problems were not the focus of the study, it can be easily admitted that these financial losses add to the food safety and quality concerns in small pelagic species (such as anchovies in Ghana), which form a noticeable part of the landings in question and are known to be prone to histamine accumulation under conducive uncontrolled time/temperature conditions. To try and reduce or prevent losses, various coping strategies are used by fishermen, processors and traders with varying degrees of success. .Despite these, as has been demonstrated by the study, losses still occur, hence the need for careful and continued technical and policy initiatives by international and national agencies. Balancing technical interventions to improve fish quality with the potential increase in selling prices, associated with better quality fish with the demand for cheaper fish by low income consumers, is an important dilemma. In this situation, a policy intervention to encourage access to alternative cheap proteins to improve the food security of low income consumers would help mitigate any downbeat effects from price increases. In conclusion, governments and development agencies should ensure that changes in post-harvest fisheries-related policy and practices take stock of the loss assessment tools, information generated and experience of the programme. Fish loss assessments should be incorporated into national data collection systems and used regularly to inform policy.

=520  3\$aMarine fisheries are very important to the economy and well-being of coastal communities. Maintaining the long-term prosperity and sustainability of marine fisheries is not only of political and social significance but also of economic and ecological importance. This review presents an updated assessment of the current status of the world's marine fishery resources. Its aim is to provide the FAO Committee on Fisheries, policy-makers, civil society, fishers and managers of world fishery resources with a comprehensive, objective and global review of the state of the living marine resources of the oceans. The review was based mainly on official catch statistics up until 2009 and relevant stock assessment and other complementary information available until 2010. This review consists of four major components. The first is a global overview of marine fishery production and the state of marine fish resources. The second part is divided into chapters that summarize and compile the information available for each FAO major fishing area, together with a discussion of the major trends and changes that have occurred with the main fishery resources exploited in each area and comments on the stock assessment work undertaken in support of fisheries management in each region. The third section is allocated to special topics that attract great attention in the international community, including tuna and tuna-like species, sharks, the Pacific islands region, deep-sea fisheries, and fisheries and long-term climate variability. The final part lists all the tables that provide details about historical and recent catches for the major marine resources and, where possible, assessments of the most current state of exploitation of fish stocks.

=520  3\$aThis review is part of a process by the Fisheries and Aquaculture Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to refine the minimum substantive requirements of the FAO guidelines for ecolabelling of marine capture fisheries, and also to consider whether a single set of requirements could be developed that was adequate to assess both marine capture fisheries and inland fisheries. Ecolabels in this context are the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Type I environmental labels, and so are voluntary with certification based on third party assessment of the environmental effects of the product. The minimum substantive requirements are the measurable or operational requirements for assessing whether a fishery can be certified and an ecolabel awarded, and they relate to the management system, the stocks under consideration and the relevant ecosystem .This review summarizes the standards, requirements and practices for well-managed fisheries as applied through internationally-managed fisheries and through national management of fisheries. The standards, requirements and practices of existing fishery ecolabels are reviewed, including government-linked ecolabels, non-governmental ecolabels and seafood guides. Seafood guides are mostly ISO Type II or Type III ecolabels that provide self-declared claims or product descriptions against preset indices, and so are not strictly comparable to the ecolabels covered by the FAO guidelines. However, these guides are reviewed here because they are increasingly widespread, sometimes used in business procurement policies, a source of information on public expectations about sustainable fisheries and some use the results of third party assessments. The special requirements of the assessment of small-scale fisheries and developing countries fisheries are considered .The primary difficulty in relation to ecolabelling of these fisheries is also the primary difficulty with their management, generally that the cost of monitoring, assessment and management can be out of proportion to the value of the fishery and/or beyond the human and infrastructure capacity that is available. However, ecolabelling requires evidence that is verifiable and auditable through third party assessment. Methods to develop, test and apply proxies, empirical indicators and risk-based assessments are available and have been applied in both small-scale and developing state fisheries. While these assessment and management approaches have not been widely applied, and they require further development, they provide promising methods to manage fishery performance in circumstances where formal (statistical) estimation of stock condition is not possible .Inland fisheries often involve significant artificial enhancements and practices that are characteristic of aquaculture, such as species introductions and translocations, artificial breeding or feeding, disease control and animal husbandry, nutrient fertilization and intentional habitat modification. These practices are counter to the current norms and requirements of wild capture fisheries, which emphasize use of naturally occurring species and the maintenance of natural biodiversity, productivity and ecosystem processes. The importance of distinguishing between wild capture fisheries, enhanced fisheries and aquaculture in ecolabelling schemes is emphasized, because otherwise products with very different ecological impacts and performance standards could appear in the marketplace with the same ecolabel. Presently, the extent of aquaculturelike enhancements that would be acceptable in a capture fishery ecolabel is unclear, and this requires further development .But suggested interim criteria are provided for enhancements that are consistent with modern capture fisheries management and that could be acceptable in a capture fishery ecolabel. Based on this review, minimum substantive requirements are suggested for the FAO guidelines on ecolabelling of marine capture fisheries.

=520  3\$aThis paper provides an updated review of world tuna fisheries. Previous studies (Miyake et al., 2004) discussed the historical development of tuna fisheries, described current world tuna fisheries, and explained the technological developments that have affected fishing operations. The current paper expands the discussion to include socioeconomic aspects of the tuna industry as a whole, specifically including recent changes in processing, trade, marketing and consumer preferences. The first half of the paper introduces the conditions under which the studies were made and the data sources. It first provides caveats and assumptions which are designed to prevent misunderstanding or misinterpretation when using the data. It then reviews the world tuna stock status based on the results of Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) scientific reviews .Even though the biomass of most of the world's tuna stocks is generally above but close to the reference point, for a few stocks fishing mortality is above the maximum sustainable yield level indicating that the stock is being overfished. World tuna fisheries (mostly longline, purse seine and baitboat [pole-and-line] fisheries) are reviewed from the standpoint of catches, technological developments and economics. Finally, tuna management measures taken by RFMOs are reviewed, including those used to mitigate bycatch. Gear and species interactions are specifically discussed in terms of allocations of the stocks between fisheries. The second half of the paper analyses tuna trade, processing, markets, consumption, price and profits for sashimi, fresh tuna steak, katsuobushi (dried skipjack stick) and canned tuna. The marketing of sashimi has changed very substantially from an exclusive Japanese market to a global one .The marketing system is also changing, because instead of being sold in market auctions, entire catches are now bought by one dealer and sold to large supermarkets or other retailers. This trend has had a clear impact on price and has resulted in the reduction of landing values. In the fresh and frozen steak tuna industry, in general, the price of tuna per unit weight is far higher than for canned materials. Since the 1960s, the production of, and demand and market for, canned tuna has increased very rapidly, accompanied by the rapid development of purse seine fisheries in tropical waters. The largest consumer of canned tuna in the 1970s was by far the United States of America, but these levels have been exceeded by European Union markets in the last two decades. The relative importance of the major markets (the United States, the European Union and Japan) has been continuously declining as a percentage of the world market .These trends have been accompanied by the concentration of capital. Another major change has involved the relocation of tuna factories from developed countries to areas closer to raw materials. This also helped the industry by cutting labour and transshipment costs, and facilitated flexible export marketing. Production was formerly dominated by the United States but as production has declined, Thailand has become the top producer in the late 1990s, followed by Spain, as a result of newly developed canning materials in the form of loins. In conclusion, because of the recent rapid increase in competition among fisheries, species, industries and even products (sashimi/fresh tuna vs. canned), the most important and most urgent issue is how to manage and allocate tuna resources among these competitors (e.g. using fishing capacity control measures and/or catch allocations) .In order to achieve such an objective it is imperative that socio-economic and ecological considerations are integrated into decision-making processes alongside capacity and allocation issues. This study does not address the broad socio-economic importance of the tuna industry to the countries in which it operates, but this type of research will be necessary in future in order to solve current fishery management problems.

=520  3\$aFreshwaters contribute 15 percent of the world's reported fish catch, or about 10.1 million tonnes in 2006, most of which comes from tropical systems. The true contribution of tropical inland fisheries is likely to be higher, as less than half of the inland capture production is actually reported. While reservoir fisheries are already an essential component of this production, the potential of most of them may even exceed their current catch levels. Opportunities exist to increase productivity, provided that environmentally and socially sustainable management systems can be adopted. To realize this untapped potential, it is necessary to improve understanding of the processes influencing reservoir productivity in such a way as to involve both biological principles and stakeholder participation, as each reservoir has different properties and different research and management institutions. .Seen in isolation, catch and productivity data of individual reservoirs may be difficult to interpret. The present technical paper attempts to address this issue by reviewing the knowledge accumulated in reservoirs in some very different tropical river basins: the Indus and Ganges/Brahmaputra Basin in India, the Nile River Basin in Eastern Africa and the Volta River Basin in West Africa. In particular, it focuses on many of the reservoirs of northern India and Pakistan in the Indus and Ganges systems, Lake Nasser in the Nile River and Lake Volta in the Volta River. Information collated from grey and published literature on the three basins is synthesized and standardized with reference to wider knowledge and up-to-date information on tropical reservoir fisheries. .A considerable quantity of data and information were collected on many aspects of the systems of the three reservoirs, including hydrological, biophysical and limnological features, primary production, and fish and fisheries data. This information was condensed and synthesized with the aim of providing a baseline against which the ecological changes that have taken place since impoundment can be described and analysed. Efforts are made to explain changes in fish catch in relation to climatic variations, ecological succession and fishing effort. The review shows that biological data and information are generally available. However, as is also common elsewhere, all three cases suffer from the general tendency to isolate and compartmentalize research into separate disciplines. .Usually, there is very limited cross-disciplinary flow of information or recognition of how results of various disciplines can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of fish populations, human communities and ecosystems and the productive activities that depend on them. This uniform tendency severely hampered the identification of relevant management actions. A more pragmatic and holistic understanding of reservoir ecosystems is needed in order to guide the choice of indicators and the development of monitoring systems that can inform management of changes in reservoir productivity and, hence, the potential catch. The next step would be to devise a hierarchy of indicators describing the different ecological and economic processes influencing fisheries catches and to organize monitoring systems around those indicators. .Only by combining information across sectoral disciplines will it be possible to reach a better understanding of the processes that drive fish stocks, fisheries and reservoir productivity.

=520  3\$aIn 2009, inland fisheries produced some 10 million tonnes of fish. Despite their importance to rural communities, especially in the least-developed countries, little attention has been paid to this sector in recent years. As a result, there is a deficit in management of the fisheries and also an increasing threat to freshwater by a number of non-fishery users of the aquatic resource. As part of an effort to raise awareness of the problems facing inland fisheries and to examine more closely the various issues, this document reviews four of the world's best-documented inland fisheries: the Amazon, Lake Constance, the Mekong and Lake Victoria. These represent two lake fisheries and two river fisheries drawn from a wide geographical sample - Africa, Asia, South America and Europe. This technical paper draws conclusions from the four case studies and more general experience as to some of the main issues facing inland fisheries. Inland fishery statistics are generally are very poor, so knowledge of the actual contribution of the sector to food security is not known. Nevertheless, inland fisheries employ about 56 million people directly and indirectly. The state of the stocks of fish in many fisheries is not known because of the low level of research across the many rivers and lakes. However, it is understood that, in many cases, the main driver of the fish assemblages is not the way in which the fishery is managed but rather the state of the environment as acted upon by other human uses. This means that mechanisms are needed to improve both management of fisheries through forms of comanagement and collaboration at the national and international level between agencies responsible for the management of the aquatic resource in general.

=520  3\$aThe aim of the study was to quantify catches of tuna and bycatch in small-scale pelagic fisheries. Additional goals were to identify on a global scale information gaps, major issues and management concerns associated with these fisheries and their bycatch. The study made estimates of tuna and non-tuna catches in the small-scale fisheries of 181 ocean areas. The total amount of tuna produced by these fisheries was around 681 000 tonnes per year in the mid-2000s. About 753 000 tonnes of non-tuna was produced by those same fisheries. The major priorities for improving our understanding of bycatch in small-scale pelagic fisheries are improved coverage of bycatch by the tuna regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) that collect such information, increased involvement of the other tuna RFMOs in small-scale pelagic fisheries, verification of the high reported catches from small-scale pelagic fisheries in Indonesia, and greater technical details on the small-scale pelagic fisheries that take sensitive species.

=520  3\$aThe field activities within the regional post-harvest loss assessment programme in small-scale fisheries in Africa (an FAO regular programme conducted from 2006 to 2008) tested and validated three key fish loss assessment methodologies that have been developed over the past two decades: the Informal Fish Loss Assessment Method (IFLAM), Load Tracking (LT) and the Questionnaire Loss Assessment Method (QLAM). This manual describes these three methods in detail and provides practical guidelines on when they can be used and on how to use them to collect reliable data, be it for planning for an intervention to reduce losses in a particular area or at the country level or monitoring and assessing the effectiveness of a loss reduction intervention. While the IFLAM is used to generate qualitative and indicative quantitative post-harvest fish loss data that can be used to inform decision-making or to plan the use of LT and the QLAM, the latter are quantitative assessment methods. . Load Tracking is used to quantify losses at stages along the distribution chain or losses related to specific activities, such as fishing, transport, processing and marketing. Key data related to the cause and effects of losses from an IFLAM study are validated using the QLAM before any suitable intervention is introduced. A combination of the IFLAM, LT and QLAM could then be used to monitor and evaluate the effects of an intervention. Illustrative examples and case studies are presented to facilitate the uptake and use of the methods in systematic fish loss assessment. This fieldwork tool also enlightens the extension officer on how to communicate the data from the assessments and the design of loss reduction interventions to help policy-planners and decision-makers understand important issues facing fishing communities. . It is hoped that this manual will be of interest to all those involved in fisheries technology and development, field research, data analysis and reporting as well as participatory approaches to development.

=520  3\$aThis technical paper is a basic guide to carp pond polyculture practicable in the Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the Caucasus and Central Asia (CCA) countries. It provides an overview on the guiding principles, aspects and tasks, and presents the most applicable production techniques and patterns of carp polyculture. For further reading and more in-depth information on the suggested techniques and technologies, it also includes a list of relevant FAO publications. It is expected that this publication will help identify resources and contribute to the successful planning and realization of fish production by those fish pond owners and operators who need to strengthen and improve their knowledge on the subject.

=520  \\$a"This Case for Action urges that improving policy coherence between employment and agricultural initiatives and investigating more in the promotion of decent rural employment contribute highly to the interlinked challenges of fighting rural poverty and feeding a growing world population in a sustainable way. Even more importantly, decent work is a fully fledged human right, enshrined in international human rights law, to which each person is entitled as a means of personal development and socio-economic inclusion. While the ILO leads the Global Employment and Decent Work Agenda, FAO has a crucial comparative advantage in promoting decent work in rural areas, specifically with respect to employment in agriculture, including livestock, forestry, fisheries and management of natural resources, as well as agroprocessing and retailing. Given its mandate to raise levels of nutrition, improve agricultural productivity, better the lives of rural populations and contribute to the growth of the world economy, FAO has a significant responsibility within this context. This Case for Action further clarifies the reasoning behind this statement and suggests entry points for increased synergies and inter-disciplinary collaboration."--Introduction.

This Rapid Guide, oriented specifically towards field missions, is designed to be used by non-specialists, consultants and other members of multidisciplinary teams from development agencies and projects. The guide is a starting-point to assist mission members to gain a new perspective on development work with the very poor and to base their project design on reality.

=520  \\$a"Carryover of veterinary drugs in feed can occur during feed processing, handling, transportation, delivery or in feeding animals on-farm. The risk of unavoidable and unintentional veterinary drug residues from feed carryover and/or transfer from feed to food of animal origin is unacceptable when it causes adverse health effects in target and/or non-target animals and/or humans consuming food originating from these animals. If carryover is not properly managed, contaminated feed can directly harm species that are sensitive to the unintended veterinary drug they consume, and /or can result in residues in food of animal origin such as meat, milk and eggs that render them unsafe for human consumption. Even if residues are not a safety hazard, they can pose regulatory and global trade issue as countries/markets may enforce a 'zero' tolerance for residues when appropriate maximum residue limits have not been established. Upon request of the Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods (CCRVDF), FAO and WHO convened an Expert Meeting to review the causes of veterinary drug carryover in animal feed and the transfer from feed to food, as well as the known risks to human health and international trade, and suggest appropriate risk management strategies. This report shows the results of the expert discussions, conclusions and recommendations."--Page 4 of cover.

Pulses, and legumes in general, can play an important role in agriculture thanks to their ability to biologically fix atmospheric nitrogen and to enhance the biological turnover of phosphorus. Indeed, they could become the cornerstone of sustainable agriculture in Africa. This publication reviews promising strategies to support the cultivation and utilization of pulses on smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa. The review is part of the legacy of the International Year of Pulses (IYP), which sought to recognize the contribution that pulses make to human well-being and the environment."

The Strategy-STA is a voluntary instrument that applies to all states and entities. Its overall objective is to provide a framework, strategy and plan for the improvement of knowledge and understanding of status and trends of aquaculture as a basis for policy-making and management. Required actions are specified, with a primary emphasis on the need for capacity building in developing countries. The basic structure and guiding principles of the strategy for capture fisheries are retained and adjustments are made as necessary to meet the specific needs of aquaculture.--Publisher's description.

=520  \\$aBetween 2007 and 2008, the world experienced a dramatic swing in commodity prices. Eastern and Southern African countries experienced considerable difficulties due to the price food swing. The food price boom resulted in increased poverty and significant food security problems as households struggled to meet the high cost of food. The decline in exports due to weak demand, decreased foreign investment and migrant remittances, as well as high unemployment all added to the burden of already vulnerable African Countries. Policy reactions to the food price surge have been prompt in many developing countries. The key objective of this title is to discuss feasible approaches for the economic management of food price booms and slumps. As a first step to policy assessment, the paper also reviews the nature of the food price swing, analyzes its impact on both household and wider economy levels and examines the policies that have been, or are currently being implemented in Eastern and Southern Africa.--Publisher's description.

=520  \\$aThe causes of salinity and sodicity, which vary between countries and regions, need to be identified, assessed and monitored carefully so that they can be managed and controlled. There is a need for practical and cost-effective methodologies for assessing, monitoring and mapping the extent and distribution of salt-affected soils; for identifying the causes and sources of the problem; and for choosing management options and evaluating the effectiveness of those options. The objective of this expert consultation was to exchange experiences with data collection and analysis for the assessment and monitoring of salinity and sodicity, with particular emphasis on practical applications at local, national, regional and global levels. Abstracts of the papers presented are included in the report, while full papers are included in the accompanying CD-ROM.--Publisher's description.

=520  \\$a"During the last four decades a number of animal-nutrition-based technologies and practices have been developed and used in developing countries, with varying degrees of success. Some technologies have produced profound beneficial effects and have been widely used, while others have shown potential on research stations but have not been taken up by farmers. To learn from these experiences, the FAO Animal Production and Health Division organised an e-conference from 1 to 30 September 2010. This document presents the current status of animal nutrition practices and technologies being practiced in developing countries and an analysis of the reasons for their success or failure. It also contains a synthesis paper that summarises the major issues discussed by participants and presents conclusion drawn and lessons learnt for the future."--back cover.

=520  \\$a"The 'livestock revolution' has generated steadily increasing levels of livestock production, making this sub-sector one of the fastest-growing in agriculture. Furthermore evidence shows that livestock provide a vital contribution to livelihoods, income and nutrition of the rural poor. Yet expansion of the livestock sector is linked with challenging problems, such as the risks of infectious animal diseases especially those that may infect humans, and potential environmental impacts. Hence despite the important contributions of private sector producers, traders and distributors, there is a continuing need for public sector policies, institutions and controls. The preparation of a Livestock Sector Review is a valuable tool in the design of policies for animal production, health and disease control, marketing and trade . Based on experience of such studies, in many developing countries, these guidelines provide indications of tried and tested approaches, analytical tools, contents, and delivery methods for the presentation of livestock sector reviews."--back cover.

=520  \\$aThis guide is written for people who work in land administration and all those with an interest in land, land tenure and their governance. Good governance can help achieve economic development and the reduction of poverty. Land issues cut across society, and a well-governed land administration system can strengthen local institutions, thereby contributing to broadly to governance. This guide explains what governance is, and what constitutes good governance in land tenure and administration. It examines the consequences of weak governance in these areas, and looks at how governance can be improved in land administration in general, as well as in some specific areas in which governance can be problematic.--Publisher's description.

=520  \\$aBangladesh, due to its geo-physical position and socio-economic context, is highly prone to regular natural hazards and the impacts of climate change. In 2005, the FAO initiated a project designed to improve the adaptive capacities of rural populations and their resilience to drought and other climate change impacts. This report provides a summary of the working approach developed and tested to promote community-based adaptation within agriculture. It presents lessons learned from the implementation process as well as the details of good practice options for drought risk management in the context of climate change.

=520  \\$a"This manual is specifically designed to help train actual and potential farm mechanization service providers, in order to increase access to sustainable farm power to raise the productivity of smallholder farmers. It focuses on two crucial aspects: the provision of farm mechanization services as a viable business opportunity for entrepreneurs, and the essential criteria of raising productivity in an environmentally sensitive and responsible way, i.e., that includes conservation agriculture. Practical guidance on the essential business development and management skills required to successfully run a mechanization service provision business are presented, with a focus on the equipment required to offer services compatible with conservation agriculture. The manual will be of particular interest to policymakers intent on achieving sustainable intensification in the agricultural sector. It is also a valuable resource for trainers charged with increasing the supply of well-trained and well-equipped entrepreneurial mechanization service providers through the implementation of training courses tailored to the specific course locations"--Foreword.

Food insecurity and a high dependence on woodfuel as a primary cooking fuel are characteristics common to vulnerable groups of people in developing regions of the world.With adequate policy and legal frameworks in place, woodfuel production and harvesting can be sustainable and a main source of green energy. Moreover, the widespread availability of woodfuel, and the enormous market for it, presents opportunities for employment and for sustainable value chains, providing further rationale for promoting this source of energy. This paper explains how sustainable woodfuel is closely linked to food security and provides insights in how the linkages could be strengthened at all stages of woodfuel production, trade and use."--Publisher's description.

This document presents the BEFS Analytical Framework (AF) developed to test this argument. Agriculture lies at the heart of the BEFS AF and allows governments to consider viable pro-poor strategies for bioenergy development. The set of tools within the BEFS AF offers an integrated approach to decision-making that combines the technical viability with the country's prevailing social and economic development objectives. This document explains the rationale and structure of the BEFS AF, provides a general overview of the tools and their application, and illustrates how the analytical information generated assists policy makers in making informed decisions concerning the many varied consequences of bioenergy developments on food security, poverty reduction and agriculture development and economic growth."--Provided by publisher.

=520  \\$aDefines and reviews certain practices that are shared between aquaculture and capture fisheries. Specifically considers the on-growing or fattening of four species groups - eels, groupers, tunas and yellowtails - which is based on the use of wild-caught "seed". Begins with an introduction on the overlap between aquaculture and fisheries and their global trends. Chapters on the four species groups follow and include information on species identification, fishery trends, the supply and transfer of "seed" for stocking purposes, aquaculture trends, culture systems, feeds and feeding regimes, fish health, harvesting and marketing. Further chapters examine the environmental and socio-economic impacts of capture-based aquaculture, together with the relevant fisheries and aquaculture management issues, and food safety issues.

=520  \\$aFAO completed its first assessment of the world's forest resources in 1948. At that time, its major objective was to collect information on available timber supply to satisfy post-war reconstruction demand. Since then, the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) has evolved into a comprehensive evaluation of forest resources and their condition, management and uses, covering all the thematic elements of sustainable forest management. This, the latest of these assessments, examines the status of, and trends in, forest resources over the period 1990-2020, drawing on the efforts of hundreds of experts worldwide. The production of FRA 2020 also involved collaboration among many partner organizations, thereby reducing the reporting burden on countries, increasing synergies among reporting processes, and improving data consistency. The results of FRA 2020 are available in several formats, including this report and an online database containing the original inputs of countries and territories as well as desk studies and regional and global analyses prepared by FAO.

=520  \\$a"This publication explains how international food safety standards are set through the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) Food Standards Programme - the Codex Alimentarius Commission - and how these standards are applied in the context of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreements on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS Agreement) and on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT Agreement). Through the FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius, members establish science-based, internationally agreed food standards. The publication describes the two organizations, how they operate together, and how countries can and should engage to keep international food standards up to date and relevant, and to resolve trade issues. The publication also highlights the need to invest in domestic capacities to be prepared now and in the future to keep food safe and to ensure that trade flows smoothly. The publication also illustrates some of the drivers of change in the area of food regulation, underlining the need for governments to be constantly attentive and ready to pick up on challenges and new opportunities, be they related to human health, consumer preferences or evolutions in technology. Members will need strong institutions and national capacity to respond to these challenges, both domestically and in the dynamic international system of food standards and trade rules that they have created. They will need to be flexible and forward looking, to enjoy the benefits and manage the risks the future holds, mindful that food is a commodity like no other."--Publisher's description.

=520  \\$a"For centuries people in Asia and the Pacific region have grown and consumed a wide variety of nutritious foods. Unfortunately, more recent generations have slowly but surely changed their diets and have moved away from many of these traditional foods. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is working with our Member Countries to reinvigorate both production and consumption of these crops - often referred to as neglected and underutilized species (NUS). This work is consistent with FAO's role in providing support to countries to meet the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), primarily, but not limited to, SDG2 which aims to achieve Zero Hunger, specifically to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture" by 2030. The Zero Hunger goal implies that no one should be left behind. The Asia-Pacific region is home to most of the world's undernourished people (490 million). Other forms of malnutrition remain challenging, including stunting and micronutrient deficiencies. While in some countries there are rising rates of overweight and obesity. The issues are manifest in both the demand side and supply side. On the demand side, there is population growth, urbanization, migration, and the changing consumption associated with rising incomes. On the supply side, the combined effects of climate change, declining agricultural biodiversity, water scarcity, land scarcity, and degradation of natural resources are threatening world food security."--Publisher's description.

=520  \\$a"This report assesses and maps 184 peer-reviewed, empirical research articles selected for their focus on linkages between water stress and human migration. First and most importantly, this literature asserts that migration is an extremely common social process and is normal in almost every society on earth. Moreover, environment- influenced migration is rarely (if ever) a resource threat to the regions to which people move. The literature does, however, observe that negative social outcomes can result from narratives that stigmatize migrants and/or cast migrants as a security threat - especially when these narratives are used to justify increased surveillance and monitoring of these people."

=520  \\$aSince 2015, Sub-Saharan Africa has experienced severe climate-induced disruptions as a result of the El Niño weather phenomenon. The severity and extent of the ongoing El Niño, with its related droughts and floods have been considered the worst since the turn of the century, and have affected the livelihoods of tens of millions of poor households. This is compounded by the increasing frequency of other shocks - civil strife and conflicts, increasing incidence of trans-boundary plant and animal pests and diseases as well as socio-economic shocks that are likely to reverse years of progress, undermining efforts by African governments to attain food security and nutrition. Because of the importance FAO and UNECA attach to resilience building, the theme of the 2016 edition of the Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition in Africa is: "The Challenge of Building Resilience to Shocks and Stresses". Thus, an entire section of this report (Part 3) focuses on issues and response mechanisms for building resilience to shocks related to food security and nutrition in the context of climate change and conflicts. The report presents in Parts 1 and 2 respectively the prevalence and trends in malnutrition, and policies and programmes in support of their improvements.--$cProvided by Publisher.

=520  \\$aCrop wild relatives are potential sources of desirable traits for breeding well-adapted varieties while wild food plants constitute important components of the diets of many people worldwide. Unfortunately, their natural wild habitats are increasingly under threat from both human activities and natural disasters. Habitat loss has a direct, negative impact on the diversity of these valuable resources. These guidelines, intended as reference materials for preparing a National Plan for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Crop Wild Relatives and Wild Food Plants, will contribute to stemming this continuing loss in diversity. The guidelines are therefore a useful tool for development practitioners, researchers, students and policy-makers who work on the conservation and sustainable use of these valuable resources.

=520  \\$a"Humans have been using pulses, and legumes in general, for millennia. Pulses currently play a crucial role in sustainable development due to their nutritional, environmental and economic values. The United Nations General Assembly, at its 68th session, declared 2016 as the International Year of Pulses to further promote the use and value of these important crops. Pulses are an affordable source of protein, so their share in the total protein consumption in some developing countries ranges between 10 and 40 percent. Pulses, like legumes in general, have the important ability of biologically fixing nitrogen and some of them are able to utilize soil-bound phosphorus, thus they can be considered the cornerstone of sustainable agriculture. Pulses also play an important role in providing valuable products for animal feeding and thus indirectly contribute to food security. Pulse by-products are valuable sources of protein and energy for animals and they do not compete with human food. Available information on this subject has been collated and synthesized in this book, to highlight the nutritional role of pulses and their by-products as animal feed. This publication is one of the main contributions to the legacy of the International Year of Pulses. It aims to enhance the use of pulses and their by-products in those regions where many pulse by-products are simply dumped and will be useful for extension workers, researchers, feed industry, policy-makers and donors alike."--Publisher's description.

=520  \\$a"This study explores the extent to which products from agroecological production systems are being valued in markets. It is based on a meta-analysis of 12 case studies (Benin, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Ecuador, France, Kazakhstan, Mozambique, Namibia, and Uganda), mainly from developing and emerging countries, as well as one developed country. The study provides a unique approach to understanding how markets are constructed for agroecological products while also supporting small-scale actors in their existing initiatives for producing and marketing their products from agroecology."

=520  \\$a"The eastern Africa sub-region has experienced recurrent climate-related impacts, with damaging effects on development, agriculture and food security. The frequency of events and the magnitude of impacts are rising; for example, since 1971 the number of people affected by drought has multiplied sevenfold. This report explores the natural potential and vulnerabilities of the sub-region's agro-ecologies, highlights institutional contexts for addressing disaster risks, and presents options to strengthen the climate resilience of agriculture and food sectors in the sub-region. Further support to disaster risk reduction in agriculture and food sectors is crucial; this includes addressing population dynamics and constraints on natural resources, making adequate financial resources available and ensuring infrastructure development." -- Back cover.

=520  3\$aThe Worldwide review of bottom fisheries in the high seas provides states and other interested parties with a summary of the current status of high seas bottom fisheries worldwide based on the best information available, including responses to an FAO questionnaire sent to high seas fishing states, the European Community and relevant regional fisheries management organizations. It contains reviews of bottom fisheries in the high seas in the following regions: the North East and North West Atlantic, the Mediterranean, the South East and South West Atlantic, the North and South Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the Southern Ocean. Fisheries are described in terms of fleets, catch and effort, and main species caught, with due consideration being given to the location of fishing activities. This document was prepared in response to the request by the FAO Committee on Fisheries (COFI) and related consideration of the issue of bottom fisheries on the high seas by the United Nations General Assembly in Resolution 61/105 on Sustainable Fisheries adopted in December 2006. It also aims at assisting in the implementation of the FAO International Guidelines for the Management of Deep-sea Fisheries in the High Seas by providing background information and highlighting gaps in the available data. According to the findings of this review, 285 vessels were active in the high seas bottom fisheries worldwide in 2006. The total catch of this fleet has been estimated to about 250 000 tonnes valued at EUR 450 million (landed value). For various reasons discussed in the report, these are to be considered minimal estimates.

=520  3\$aThis document contains the report of the FAO/APFIC Regional Workshop on Port State Measures to Combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing for the South Asian Subregion, which was held in Bangkok, Thailand, from 10 to 13 February 2009. The objective of the Workshop was to develop national capacity and promote bilateral, subregional and/or regional coordination so that countries would be better placed to strengthen and harmonize port State measures and, as a result, implement further the 2001 FAO International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, the 2005 FAO Model Scheme on Port State Measures to Combat Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing and the Chairperson's Draft Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, if and when it enters into force. The Workshop addressed: the background and framework for port State measures; subregional and regional approaches to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and the implementation of port State measures; the Chairperson's Draft Agreement and the role of the Asia Pacific Fishery Commission; national coordination and implementation of port State measures, and perspectives on port State measures, including responses to the FAO questionnaire that was circulated prior to the Workshop to collect information relating to port State measures in the South Asian subregion. Working groups were formed to enhance the participatory nature of the Workshop and as a means of engendering broader and deeper discussion on concepts and issues relating to port State measures. In the first exercise, participants addressed multidisciplinary aspects of port State measures, and in the second exercise, thematic issues were considered. The final session of the Workshop entitled "Looking ahead: and agenda for the subregion on port State measures" sought to identify key issues to be addressed by countries after the Workshop. Funding and support for the Workshop were provided by the FAO Regular Programme and by the Governments of Norway, Sweden and the United States of America.

=520  3\$aThis technical paper provides a comprehensive review of the use of wild fish as feed inputs for aquaculture covering existing practices and their sustainability as well as implications of various feed-fish fisheries scenarios. It comprises four regional reviews (Africa and the Near East, Asia and the Pacific, Europe, and Latin America and North America) and three case studies from Latin America (Chile, Peru and the study on the use of the Argentine anchoita in Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil). The four regional reviews specifically address the sustainable use of finite wild fish resources and the role that feed-fish fisheries may play for food security and poverty alleviation in these four regions and elsewhere. With additional information from case studies in China and Viet Nam, a global synthesis provides a perspective on the status and trends in the use of fish as feed and the issues and challenges confronting feed-fish fisheries. Based on the information presented in the global synthesis, regional reviews and three case studies, and through the fresh analysis of information presented elsewhere, an exploratory paper examines the use of wild fish as aquaculture feed from the perspective of poverty alleviation and food security.

=520  3\$aThis document contains the report of the FAO Expert Workshop on the "Application of Biosecurity Measures to Control Salmonella Contamination in Sustainable Aquaculture" held in Mangalore, India from 19 to 21 January 2010. The experts reviewed the current scientific evidence regarding the pathogen Salmonella enterica, its occurrence and survival in aquatic environment, possible pathways of contamination of aquaculture systems, serovars found in seafood and salmonellosis associated with fish and fishery products. The experts agreed that although Salmonella is a major foodborne pathogen, products of aquaculture are rarely involved in outbreaks of salmonellosis and the serovars which have been reported in products of aquaculture are rarely reported in cases of human salmonellosis in fish importing countries. The experts recognized that there are a variety of pathways reported as to how Salmonella can enter the aquaculture environment ranging from wild animals, domestic stock, poor sanitation and inappropriate disposal of human and animal wastes. Control of such pathways poses major challenges such as land runoff during rains, control of wild animals in the farm environment. There was agreement that very low level prevalence of Salmonella can be seen in products from aquaculture systems in developed countries but this has not led to any particular public health problem in these countries. The experts agreed that good hygienic practices during aquaculture production and biosecurity measures can minimize but not eliminate Salmonella in products of aquaculture. Biosecurity and control measures that would be useful in minimizing the risk of Salmonella contamination of aquaculture products were identified. The experts identified data gaps and made a series of recommendations to the national governments, national competent authorities, aquaculture industry and FAO.

=520  \\$a"This book is an effort by FAO to compile an up-to-date, comprehensive text on rural structures and services in the tropics, focusing on structures for small- to medium-scale farms and, to some extent, village-scale agricultural infrastructure. The earlier edition, entitled Farm structures in tropical climates: a textbook for structural engineering and design, published in 1986, has been used for over two decades as a standard textbook for teaching undergraduate and postgraduate courses on rural structures and services in universities throughout sub-Saharan Africa. This second edition will help to improve teaching - at all educational levels - on the subject of rural buildings in developing countries in the tropics and it will assist professionals currently engaged in providing technical advice on rural structures and services, from either agricultural extension departments or non-governmental rural development organizations. This book will also provide technical guidance in the context of disaster recovery and rehabilitation, for rebuilding the sound rural structures and related services that are key to development and economic sustainability. While this book is intended primarily for teaching university - and college-level agricultural engineering students about rural structures and services, resources might be made available to produced textbooks based on this material for teaching at other educational levels. Although parts of the background material relate specifically to East and Southeast Africa, the book's principles apply to the whole of tropical Africa, Latin America and South Asia because, while building traditions may vary, the available materials are similar."--Back cover.

=520  3\$aThis checklist summarizes information on the parasites of Latvia fishes contained in the world literature dating to the end of 2005. Information is presented in the form of parasite-host and hostparasite lists and includes 305 named species of parasites, distributed among the higher taxa as follows: Protista - 42, Myxozoa - 49, Digenea - 38, Monogenoidea - 81, Cestoda - 33, Nematoda - 31, Acanthocephala - 11, Hirudinida - 2, Mollusca - 6, Branchiura - 2 and Copepoda - 10. Also included are many records of parasites not identified to species level. The Parasite-Host List is organized on a taxonomic basis and provides information for each parasite species on the environment (freshwater, brackish, marine), the location (site of infection) in or on its host(s), the species of host(s) infected, the known geographic distribution (by major waterbody) in Latvia, and the published sources for each host and locality record. The Host-Parasite List is organized according to the taxonomy of the hosts, and includes for each host, the English language, Latvian and Russian common names, environment (freshwater, brackish, marine), status in Latvia (native or exotic) and the list of parasites reported. Both lists are accompanied by remarks, as warranted, giving specific information on points of systematics, nomenclature, possible misidentifications, introductions, life cycles, etc. Citations are included for all references and parasite and host indices are included. The parasite fauna of fishes of Latvia has received considerable attention. Nevertheless, parasites have been recorded from only about 45 percent of the more than 114 species of marine and fish occurring in the country's waters. The common freshwater fish species (particularly those having economic importance, such as the cyprinids, percids, esocids and salmonids) have been particularly well studied, providing a good general picture of their parasite faunas and data having value for use in faunistic analyses.

=520  3\$aThis technical paper provides an analysis of the economic implications of, and the reasons for, adopting various feeding practices for different fish species and aquaculture systems in Asia. It comprises of six selected country case study reports from Asia (Bangladesh, China, India, the Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam) and an overall synthesis ending with conclusions and recommendations. Field survey for the case studies was carried out between 15 October 2005 and 14 February 2006 and three hundred and fourty Asian fish farmers were interviewed about their fish feeding practices. In India and China selected farmers were engaged in carp polyculture, in Bangladesh and Viet Nam they raised sutchi catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) and pangasiid catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus and Pangasius bocourti) respectively, in Thailand hybrid catfish (Clarias gariepinus x C. macrocephalus). In the Philippines those undertaking polyculture of giant freshwater prawn and milkfish participated. Prior to the random selection of farmers each national group of farmers had been stratified according to three broad categories of feeding practices. These were (i) use of industrially produced pelleted feed (intensive farmers), (ii) use of industrial and farm-made feed mixes (semi-intensive), and (iii) use of on-farm feeds consisting of a mixture of locally available feed ingredients (traditional/ extensive). The 340 respondents represent these three feeding categories in about equal proportions, and include 60 farmers by country with the exception of India in which 40 farmers were interviewed. After completion of the field survey and the preliminary analyses, the researchers involved in the case studies met to agree on methods and an outline for country reports. After agreeing on the methodology and outline of the country reports, the authors of the case studies, for each feeding strategy and farming system, analyzed demographic factors (including age and marital status, education and ownership structure), physical characteristics (average number of ponds and average pond size), and other input features (stocking strategies, feeding practices, types of feed, frequency and intensity of feeding and labour utilization). The case studies also identified the principal input costs, assessed the economic rates of return (gross and net margins), returns to labour, land and capital, gross and net total factor productivity, break-even prices and production and returns on capital for each feeding strategy. Problem areas were identified for the different farming systems. A statistical analysis using either regression analysis or the Cobb Douglas production function established the existence, or non-existence, for each feeding strategy of the relationships between aquaculture production and or profit as the dependent variable and a number of independent factors.
