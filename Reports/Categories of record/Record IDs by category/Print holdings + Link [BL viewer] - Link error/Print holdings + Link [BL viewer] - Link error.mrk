Sent to France for the Queen's midwife in 1630, & made prisoner by a Flemish pirate. Made a captain of horse in the Civil Wars; & fights a duel on horseback with Mr. Crofts, whom he kills with the first fire. Again made captive at sea, by a Turkish rover, & carried into slavery where he remains some years. Redeemed; settles for a time in his native county, & afterwards removes to London. Committed to the Gate House as a Papist, & dies soon after his release in his sixty-third year."

Notwithstanding these disadvantages he has by industry acquired the arts of writing and drawing, holding his pencil between the stump of his left arm and his cheek & guiding it with the muscles of his mouth. In order to assist these extraordinary efforts of ingenuity, this drawing was presented to him by Mr. Robertson, & Mr. Fittler kindly superintended the etching. This print is sold by T. Inglefield at no. 8, Chapel Street, Tottenham Court Road, where ladies & gentlemen may see him & many more of his performances.".
