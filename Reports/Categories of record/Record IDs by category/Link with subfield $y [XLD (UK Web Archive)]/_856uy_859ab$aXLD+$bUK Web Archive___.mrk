=520  \\$aThis collection of websites focuses on the election for the National Assembly for Wales in 2011. The Assembly was established in 1999, but the fourth Assembly, would be the first to have full lawmaking powers in devolved areas. The election resulted in gains for the Labour and Conservative parties and losses for the Welsh Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru but with no party having an overall majority. Following the election, Carwyn Jones AM, leader of the Labour group was elected as First Minister and formed a government. Etholiad Cynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru 2011 Mae'r casgliad hwn o wefannau yn canolbwyntio ar yr etholiad i Gynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru yn 2011. Sefydlwyd y Cynulliad yn 1999, ond y Pedwerydd Cynulliad, fyddair cyntaf i gael pwerau deddfu llawn mewn meysydd sydd wedi'u datganoli. Canlyniad yr etholiad oedd enillion ar gyfer y Blaid Lafur ar Ceidwadwyr a cholledion ar gyfer Democratiaid Rhyddfrydol Cymru a Phlaid Cymru, ond heb unrhyw blaid gyda mwyafrif. Yn dilyn yr etholiad, etholwyd Carwyn Jones AC, arweinydd y grŵp Llafur, yn Brif Weinidog a ffurfiodd lywodraeth.

=520  \\$aOn the 18th September 2014 voters were asked 'should Scotland be an independent country'. The results of this vote saw the electorate voting 55.3% in favour of remaining within the UK. For the first time in the UK, and specifically for that vote, 16 and 17 year olds were eligible to cast their ballots. Those born in other parts of the UK but resident in Scotland at the time of the vote were also eligible to vote, while those born in Scotland but no longer living there were not.

The Rising, or more particularly the centenary of the events in Dublin in 1916, is being explored and represented in new ways thanks to technology and the work of colleagues at Trinity College Dublin and the Bodleian Libaries, University of Oxford.

It captures how UK based public forums are used to discuss hobbies and activities and serve as a place for enthusiasts to converse with others sharing similar interests. It gives an insight into how hobbyists of the British public are using the internet right now to further their social and recreational activities, and show the use of online communities in an everyday, routine manner rather than providing reactions to a particular event. The range of interests covered by online communities within the UK is surprisingly vast - it is possible to find anything from the more traditional areas, such as stamp collecting and cycling, to the more esoteric, such as a community for those dedicated to turning their raspberry pi computers into retro gaming machines.

=520  \\$aOn the 8th November 2013 Typhoon Haiyan (also known as Yolanda), the strongest storm ever recorded at landfall, hit the Philippines, causing at least 6,200 fatalities. With more than 25,000 people injured, an estimated 4 million people homeless and the infrastructure of whole regions destroyed, the Philippines faced a humanitarian crisis. This collection captures internet sites with content about the UK response to Typhoon Haiyan, including news and commentary from national and regional news sites, information and appeals from charity and aid organisations' websites, Government pages, community group websites and blogs from immediately after the typhoon in November 2013 until January 2014. The websites in this collection have been selected by staff at the Bodleian Libraries, University of Oxford to reflect the diversity of the UK's humanitarian aid response to Typhoon Haiyan, but also the political response, and emerging debates such as climate change and its impact on severe weather events, or the structures and efficiency of foreign aid in general.

The outbreak began in April 2015 in Brazil, and spread to other countries in South America, Central America, North America, and the Caribbean. In January 2016, the World Health Organisation said the virus was likely to spread throughout most of the Americas by the end of the year; and in February 2016, the WHO declared the cluster of microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome cases reported in Brazil - strongly suspected to be associated with the Zika outbreak - a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. It was estimated that 1.5 million people were infected by Zika in Brazil, with over 3,500 cases of microcephaly reported between October 2015 and January 2016. The collection gives and insight into the UK reactions and perception of this public health emergency.

The collection is tagged according to the standard divisions of the sciences under Universal Decimal Classification, using the names as listed as follows: Agriculture, Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Communications, Earth sciences, Engineering, Physics. The collection will not cover computer science or information technology as there is already a web archive collection for this subject area. Science is also represented by several curated collections within the UK Web Archive, dealing with specific subjects such as disease pandemics, science at Cambridge University, the Medical Royal Colleges, and the late Stephen Hawking.

The collection was initiated in March 2020 by the British Library's Government and Official Information Team in partnership with the other UK Legal Deposit Libraries.

=520  \\$aThis collection was started in 2020 by the Royal College of Nursing History of Nursing Forum. 2020 marked 200 years since the birth of Florence Nightingale and was designated by the World Health Organisation as the International Year of the Nurse and Midwife. Instead of celebrating these milestones, 2020 saw our nursing staff across the NHS and independent nursing at the forefront of COVID-19. Nursing is the largest profession in the UK, in 2020 there were over 700,000 registered nurses - not including nursing associates and health care professionals. Nursing first became a registered profession in the UK in 1919 and remains approximately 90% women. One in every five nurses, midwives and health visitors in the NHS is from a black and minority ethnic (BME) background. This collection aims to reflect the breadth and depth of our nursing community of practice, which is diverse in terms of geography, clinical specialisms, ethnicity and special interests. The collection includes content from the four branches of nursing - adult, children, mental health and learning disability. Individuals, specialist community networks and the history of nursing are included. It does not cover dental or veterinary nursing which are different professions. Nominations to develop in the collection are welcomed.

According to the UK Parliament there were 5.9 million businesses in the UK in 2019. A large proportion of these have websites of some description, though increasing some businesses exist solely on social media. We cannot hope to collect all of these websites within the special collection however the we will attempt to include as many as possible, ranging from one page of a local restaurant to multipage sites of large retailers or multinational manufacturers. The structure of the collection is based on the format of the UK SIC (Standard Industrial Classification) codes but adapted for use in this particular context.

Additional criteria that inform the selection process include whether content is only published on the web, whether a website is at risk of being lost, and whether selection would result in a more comprehensive collection.

=520  \\$a2018 marks 25 years since the passing of the Welsh Language Act in 1993 which gives effect to the principle that in the conduct of public business and the administration of justice in Wales the English and Welsh languages should be treated 'on the basis of equality'. The powers given to the Secretary of State for Wales under this Act were later devolved to the National Assembly for Wales in 1997. Over the past 25 years, an underlying theme has been looking at ways to promote and facilitate the use of the Welsh language in all walks of life. This is a collection of websites relating to the Welsh language collected by the UK Web Archive. Eleni, 2018, mae'n bum mlynedd ar hugain o flynyddoedd ers i Ddeddf yr Iaith Gymraeg 1993 ddod i rym, deddf sydd yn gweithredu'r egwyddor y dylid trin y Gymraeg a'r Saesneg ar sail eu bod yn gyfartal wrth gynnal busnes cyhoeddus a gweinyddu cyfiawnder yng Nghymru. Yn ddiweddarach yn 1997, datganolwyd y grymoedd a roddwyd i Ysgrifennydd Gwladol Cymru o dan y ddeddf hon i Gynulliad Cenedlaethol Cymru. Yn ystod y pum mlynedd ar hugain ddiwethaf mae hi wedi bod yn nod sylfaenol polisi cyhoeddus yng Nghymru i edrych ar ffyrdd o hybu a hwyluso defnydd o'r Gymraeg ym mhob agwedd ar fywyd. Mae hwn yn gasgliad o wefannau sydd yn ymwneud â'r Gymraeg ac sydd wedi eu casglu gan Archif We y Deyrnas Gyfunol.

=520  \\$aThe UK Blogosphere (connected community of Web logs) has burgeoned since the late 1990s and early 2000s, due in part to the advent of web publishing tools that facilitated the posting of content by non-technical users. Until 2009 Blogs were generally the work of a single author, in the 2010s Multi Author Blogs (MABs) developed. This collection curated by staff at the British Library from 2005 onwards, represents a cross section of UK Web logs containing a wealth of material which will be of value to researchers now and in the future. The collection contains a wide variety of Blogs from news and political commentaries, sports and music Blogs to personal online diaries.

The British Overseas Territories (BOTs) are fourteen territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom, although they do not form part of the United Kingdom. Most of the permanently inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. Three are inhabited only by a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They all share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state.

E-publishing is a growing phenomenon which uses innovative technologies to enable individuals, scholars and communities to establish contacts, exchange data, and share knowledge. Many works, especially scientific journals and popular works of fiction are increasingly only published online. This collection of websites, curated by staff at the British Library, is intended to reflect this growing trend and includes e-books, a publisher's online addenda to a printed book, an experiment in the novel as a blog and sites about the impact of digital technologies upon writing.

=520  \\$aThis collection of websites has been selected around the theme of Free Church religion. The Free Churches (successively known in previous generations as Dissenters and Nonconformists) formally emerged in the seventeenth century. They originally comprised individuals and denominations refusing to conform to the doctrines and practices of the Church of England but have come to include a large number of evangelical and renewal movements which have grown up quite independently of the established Church. Most, but not all, of them are trinitarian. The major categories, in terms of numerical strength, currently comprise Baptist, Methodist, Reformed and Pentecostal. In addition to the websites included in this collection, there is a separate special collection for the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers).

This system was replaced by a single elected individual (a Police & Crime Commissioner) following the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011, and elections on Thursday 15th November 2012. This collection contains snapshots of all 41 police authority sites at or near the changeover date of 20th November. It also includes sites from the newly elected Police and Crime Commissioners, and selected sites relating to the first elections of 2012. It also includes the sites of the police forces and associated organisations in Scotland superseded by the Police Service of Scotland from April 2013, under the terms of the Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012.

Over this time LGBTQ+ (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, Queer/Questioning) issues have moved from something scarcely mentioned - in fact barely legal - into the mainstream. The British Library's collections of LGBTQ+ printed materials go back almost 500 years and, augmented by more recent material in the Sound Archive, provide a unique resource for research into the subject. This collection of websites augments these collections as well as the collections of the other five UK Legal Deposit Libraries to reflect comptemporary aspects of LGBTQ+ life in modern Britain.

Live Art is an innovative exploratory approach to contemporary performance practices. The range of websites in this collection includes organizations supporting, promoting and curating Live Art; artists websites; sites that are artistic or project-driven by their nature; blogsites and online spaces engaging in critical reviews; through to online archival sites relating to Live Art. This collection represents the diverse practices and approaches of artists today and the support and critical frameworks that exist to support, promote and comment upon Live Art and the ephemeral nature of this area of practice. This project was revisited in 2017 with new websites added to the collection.

Baroness Thatcher (1925 - 2013) was a British stateswoman who was Prime Minister of the UK from 1979 to 1990 and Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1990. She was the longest-serving British prime minister of the 20th century, and the first woman to have held the office. A Soviet journalist dubbed her The Iron Lady, a nickname that became popularly associated with her uncompromising politics and leadership style.

=520  \\$aMuslims, Trust and Cultural Dialogue is an RCUK-funded international research project that explores trust between Muslims and non-Muslims in Britain, Europe and North America. The project analyses the conditions of trust and mistrust in three overlapping areas of modern life: politics and society; business and finance; and art and culture. It is an international multidisciplinary network of scholars, practitioners and stakeholders exploring questions of trust in the relationship between Muslim diaspora populations in the West and the societies around them. The project is committed to understanding how existing practices in these three arenas enact dialogue and negotiation between groups in ways that can be mutually informative, and which help us move beyond misunderstanding and negative stereotyping. - See more at: http://www.muslimstrustdialogue.org/index.php/about#sthash.sCNaSzzY.dpuf

Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela (1918 - 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid revolutionary, politician, and philanthropist, who served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as President of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.

=520  \\$aThe Oral History in the UK collection was initiated in 2012 and is maintained by the Oral History section of the British Library. The websites in this collection have been selected to demonstrate the variety of ways in which Oral History is used by community and local history groups, charities and universities. The range of websites in this collection includes sites which document the experiences of those that emmigrated to the UK (such as the Birmingham Black Oral History Project and Moroccan Memories in Britain); local history (Durham in Time, St. Helier Memories); disability history (Speaking Up For Disability); industry in the UK (Songs of Steel); and memories of war (The Workers' War, Captive Memories). The websites vary widely in the way they present oral history; many, although not all, provide access to extracts from oral history audio or video archive material and most sites also provide information on the project background, participants and funding arrangements. Websites will continue to be nominated for inclusion in the UK Web Archive and added to the 'Oral History in the UK' collection. if you would like to nominate any content to the collection you can fill in the online form: https://beta.webarchive.org.uk/en/ukwa/info/nominate.

This collection has been curated by Hannah Connell, a collaborative doctoral student at the British Library and King's College London. The selection of the content for the Russia in the UK collection forms part of a Collaborative Doctoral Partnership Studentship researching migration and diaspora through Russian-language publishing. This collection reflects the ways in which diasporic communities continue to preserve and contribute to a shared identity though new forms of media today. In preserving and indexing the online presence of the Russian-speaking community in the UK, this collection also contributes to the British Library's knowledge of the communities which create and use its collections.

The comics cover a wide variety of subjects and are produced by a diverse range of creators, including many voices not frequently represented in traditional publishing. The collection includes examples of renowned (and sometimes award-winning) webcomics, as well as independently produced comics which may not be as well-known. Due to current technological restrictions in capturing online material (as of 2017), some elements of these items (such as embedded video) may not appear within the archived item as they did when published online. The collection was curated by Jennifer Aggleton, a doctoral placement student at the British Library.

The British Library selected national political party and constituency websites, candidates' campaign websites, articles from UK-based news sites, and campaign materials and manifestos issued by UK-based interest groups and think tanks. To give a rounded picture of the campaign, the collection also includes some materials from Pan-European civil society organisations and political parties and groupings and EU institutions based in the UK.

=520  \\$aThe Health and Social Care Act 2012 brought in the most extensive reorganisation of the structure of the National Health Service in England to date. It removed responsibility for the health of citizens from the Secretary of State for Health, which the post had carried since the inception of the NHS in 1948. It abolished NHS primary care trusts (PCTs) and Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) and transferred between £60 billion and £80 billion of "commissioning", or health care funds from the abolished PCTs to several hundred "clinical commissioning groups". These were to be partly run by the general practitioners (GPs) in England but formed a major point of access for private service providers. A new executive agency of the Department of Health, Public Health England, was established under the Act on 1 April 2013. The collection was created during 2013 and 2014 and aimed to capture sites before and after implementation of the reform. The websites in this collection, selected by staff at the British Library, include those of the Primary Care Trusts (PCTs), Public health agencies, health and wellbeing boards, Acute trusts, Clinical Commissioning Groups, LINks and their successor bodies, professional bodies, Royal Colleges, unions, Private Sector Care providers, Health Care organisations, charities, patient's groups, political parties, MPs, Central Government, the Department of Health, regulatory bodies, Local Councils, the Press/news, opposing groups/commentators, blogs, twitter feeds, social media, scholarly institutions and research organisations.

=520  \\$aThe 2015 general election took place on May 7th and was the first called under the Fixed-Term Parliament Act 2011. It resulted in a Conservative government led by David Cameron with a small majority. The collection is the third in the UK General Elections series curated by the legal deposit libraries. The sites were collected between March and July 2015, during and shortly after the campaign. To maintain consistency over time, it includes all major and minor political party national sites, blogs and social media feeds. The sample of candidate and constituency party sites for England is identical to that used in 2005, i.e. the same shire county and urban conurbation for each region and the same six London Boroughs (three inner and three outer). Candidate and constituency sites are covered comprehensively for Scotland and Wales and selectively for Northern Ireland (Belfast, Derry and Fermanagh and Tyrone). There is very extensive coverage of news and comment by both the quality and popular press, indexed at the level of the individual article, manifestos issued by campaigning charities, pressure groups and trade and professional associations, opinion polls, and analysis by think tanks and academia.

The sites were collected between April and September 2017, during and shortly after the campaign. To maintain consistency over time, it includes all major and minor political party national sites, blogs and Twitter feeds. The sample of candidate and constituency party sites for England is identical to that used in 2005, i.e. the same shire county and urban conurbation for each region and the same six London Boroughs (three inner and three outer). Candidate and constituency sites are covered comprehensively for Scotland and Wales and selectively for Northern Ireland (Belfast, Derry and Fermanagh and Tyrone). There is extensive coverage of manifestos and campaign materials issued by charities, pressure groups and trade and professional associations aiming to influence the next government, opinion polls, and analysis by think tanks and academia. A representative sample of UK news sources is present, but not indexed at the article level.

HCID's are characterised by acute infectious illness, ability to spread person-to-person, high case-fatality rate, difficulty in rapid recognition and detection, lack of effective treatments and the need for coordination at the national level to appropriately respond. The purpose of this report is simply to raise awareness.

The British Library captured the websites of over 700 of the cluster of companies, educational institutions and other organisations associated with the Cambridge Network between 2011 and 2013. The collection comprises many research centres and enterprises associated with the University of Cambridge, such as the Centre for Business Research or the Centre for Advanced Photonics and Electronics (CAPE). Also included are the sites of organisations whose purpose is to facilitate knowledge exchange in general, such as the UK Innovation Research Centre or the Huntingdonshire Business Network. There are also websites from local government, the law, financial services, the charitable sector and the many other parts that go to make up the rich ecology of business in a local area. This collection will hopefully be of great value in capturing a snapshot of innovation in progress in a particular geographical area.

This occasion was commemorated across the United Kingdom with a variety of events such as tree planting, street parties, and food competitions. The Jubilee provided the opportunity to remark upon the interactions between the public and the monarchy, while also affording the chance to examine the changes in British society by looking at the last 70 years of British History. This collection of websites was curated by Daniela Major, a PhD candidate at the School of Advanced Study, University of London.

The invasion caused Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II, with more than 7.7 million Ukrainians fleeing the country and a third of the population displaced. This collection of websites was initiated by the Legal Deposit Libraries in response to these events. The collection currently includes websites of Russian Oligarchs in the UK, Commentators, Charities, Think Tanks and the UK Embassies of Ukraine and the surrounding nations. The collection will remain open to document the conflict as it unfolds and to reflect longer term developments such as fuel and agricultural crises resulting from the conflict.

The exhibition explored contemporary debates around women's rights and gender equality in the UK in the context of a long history of activism while this web collection is a snapshot of the surge of activism around women's rights issues that has emerged online. The UK Web Archive also has two complimentary web archive collections. The Gender Equality collection is still active and seeking nominations while the Women's Issues collection was a collaboration with the Women's Library at LSE from 2005 to 2013.

=520  \\$aSince the early 19th century, different groups of Chinese people from diverse geographical locations, either as travellers or settlers, have arrived in the UK in different periods of time, for various reasons, and through different routes. People of Chinese heritage are culturally and linguistically diverse. Over the past two decades, the Chinese population in the UK have become increasingly dynamic and diverse in the dual contexts of China's global rise and multicultural Britain. However, there is a lack of documentation of this changing population, including their online presence. "Chinese in the UK", a sub-collection within the upcoming "East and Southeast Asians in the UK" collection, aims to preserve the digital traces of the history and lived experiences of people, who acknowledge "Chinese" as part of their multiple identities, through archiving the websites created by and/or for them. "Chinese in the UK'' collection contributes to enriching our understanding of these individuals and communities, who have been shaping the UK's multicultural identity. The collection also contributes to documenting the process of the negotiation of multiple identities and belongings of this racially minoritised group who face persistent exclusion and racism in Britain. Xiao Ma, the lead curator of this collection, is a Doctoral Researcher at the University of Westminster. Her research explores the cultural complexities of London Chinatown from a heritage perspective. Xiao collects the websites for this collection within the framework of her doctoral project to increase her understanding of the population's digital presence and to encourage anti-essentialist and nuanced understanding of British Chinese people among the general public."

=520  \\$aThe Northern Ireland Protocol has been the source of acute political, economic and societal difficulties in the two years since it has been operating. The prospect of rigorous implementation of the Protocol has been regarded by communities and businesses in Northern Ireland as unworkable without lasting economic and political damage. The Protocol has already led to significant disruption in the links between Great Britain and Northern Ireland that are integral to its place in our Union and the UK's internal market. The Windsor Framework delivers a form of dual regulation that will work for business and consumers in Northern Ireland, based on the restoration of Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market, and reflecting that by far the greatest portion of Northern Ireland's economic life will continue to be based on trade within the United Kingdom. As a result over 1,700 pages of EU law - with accompanying European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction - are disapplied, meaning that core UK trade is based on core UK internal market rules, whether citizens and businesses are based in Belfast or Birmingham.

=520  \\$aSoil nutrient balances provide a method for estimating the annual nutrient loadings of nitrogen and phosphorus to agricultural soils. They give an indication of the potential risk associated with losses of nutrients to the environment; losses which can impact on air and water quality and on climate change. The nutrient balances are used as a high-level indicator of farming's pressure on the environment and of how that pressure is changing over time. The balances do not estimate the actual losses of nutrients to the environment, but significant nutrient surpluses are directly linked with losses to the environment. Nutrient balances are of direct relevance to policies relating to agriculture and the environment including climate change, air quality, water quality, and habitats and biodiversity.

The virus is easily transmitted through contact with infected individuals from one person to another. Outbreaks are common in semi-enclosed environments such as hospitals, nursing homes, schools and cruise ships and can also occur in restaurants and hotels. The virus is usually mild and lasts for 1 to 2 days. Symptoms include vomiting, projectile vomiting, diarrhoea and fever. Most people make a full recovery within a couple of days but it can be dangerous for the very young and elderly people.

=520  \\$aThe Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs met with representatives from across the whole UK food supply chain to discuss how government and industry can work together to support a thriving UK food industry. This note summarises the key themes that were discussed as well as the steps government is taking to support farmers to strengthen food security and grow the economy. The event built on progress made since the government's Food Strategy was published last year, in which we committed to broadly maintaining the current level of food we produce domestically while sustainably boosting production in sectors such as horticulture and seafood.

Whilst it is not practicable to monitor every aspect of our environment, trends in selected species or environments can provide a good indication of the broad state of biodiversity.

=520  \\$aRoad length statistics provide estimates of the length of all roads maintained at public expense in Great Britain, by road category and region. Within these statistics, roads are classified as either "major" or "minor". Major roads include motorways and all class 'A' roads. These roads usually have high traffic flows and are often the main arteries to major destinations. Minor roads comprise 'B' and 'C' classified roads in addition to unclassified roads.In addition to road class, road lengths statistics are classified by urban and rural roads. Urban roads are major and minor roads that sit within a built up area, with a population of 10,000 or more in England and Wales or 3,000 or more in Scotland. Rural roads are major and minor roads outside urban areas.

=520  \\$aThis Policy Framework sets out the arrangements, mandatory requirements, and general guidance for use of the OASys Sexual reoffending Predictor (OSP). OSP replaced Risk Matrix 2000 as the HMPPS actuarial risk assessment tool for adult males convicted of sexual/sexually motivated offences from 1 March 2021. HMPPS plays a vital role in protecting the public from those who pose a risk of sexual offending. Effective risk assessment is a critical part of this process and informs the way in which we manage the risk of harm posed by such individuals. In addition to strengthening risk assessment, OSP will also support more effective risk management and responsive sentence planning for those who pose a risk of sexual harm.

=520  \\$aThe collection includes Statutory homelessness statistics, which provide quarterly information about those who local authorities have a duty to accommodate as they are homeless through no fault of their own, eligible for assistance, and have a 'priority need'. This primarily includes those with children or a vulnerability, including disability or mental ill-health. It also includes information about new statutory duties created by the Homelessness Reduction Act to try and prevent and relieve homelessness for single people, regardless of priority need, or intentional homelessness. It also contains Rough sleeping snapshot statistics, about people sleeping rough on a single night in autumn each year. These statistics provide a way of estimating the number of people sleeping rough across England on a single night and assessing change over time. Finally, Rough sleeping management information is about the support for people sleeping rough. This quarterly information provides a fuller picture of the dynamic and seasonal nature of rough sleeping, and illustrates the work done by local authorities to provide a pathway off the streets and into long-term accommodation.

=520  \\$aIn July 2020, the Home Office (HO) announced the launch of a UK-wide pilot programme to support victims/survivors of domestic abuse who otherwise had no recourse to public funds (NRPF): the Support for Migrant Victims (SMV) Pilot. HO commissioned the Behavioural Insights Team (BIT) to undertake an independent evaluation of the Pilot. Overall, the evaluation presents a mixed picture. There were clear examples of where the Pilot was performing well, particularly in meeting the immediate and emergency needs of victims/survivors. However, BIT also identified several areas in which victims'/survivors' needs were not being fully met, where provision and experiences were highly dependent on the victims'/survivors' specific circumstances, or where the administration of the Pilot placed additional burden on delivery partners.

=520  \\$aThe introduction of minimum service levels (MSLs) is designed to enable people to continue to attend their place of work, access education and healthcare, and to protect the UK's security and infrastructure during strikes, whilst preserving the ability to strike. Where MSLs are applied, there should be a more consistent level of service for the public from strike to strike, as well as minimising the circumstances in which there are no services at all. This will help protect the public and guard against disproportionate risks to lives and livelihoods. The Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Act 2023 received Royal Assent on 20 July 2023. It creates a framework for delivering MSLs in the event of strike action in key sectors, including border security. This consultation sets out considerations in defining essential border services and considerations in defining a border security MSL for Border Force.

The Energy Bill Relief Scheme (EBRS) offered a unit price cap for all firms for six months from 1 October 2022. In effect, the government offered a discount on wholesale gas and electricity prices for all eligible non-domestic customers. From 1 April 2023 the scheme changed to the Energy Bills Discount Scheme.
