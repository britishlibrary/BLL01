It is based on four sources: 1) A GIS modelling using a statistical estimation of peak-flow magnitude and a hydrological model using HydroSHEDS dataset and the Manning equation to estimate river stage for the calculated discharge value. 2) Observed flood from 1999 to 2007, obtained from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO). 3) The frequency was set using the frequency from UNEP/GRID-Europe PREVIEW flood dataset. In area where no information was available, it was set to 50 years returning period. 4) A population grid for the year 2010, provided by LandScanTM Global Population Database (Oak Ridge, TN: Oak Ridge National Laboratory). 4) A Global Domestic Product grid for the year 2010, provided by the World Bank. Unit is expected average annual GDP (2010 as the year of reference) exposed in (US {dollar}, year 2000 equivalent). This product was designed by UNEP/GRID-Europe for the Global Assessment Report on Risk Reduction (GAR). It was modelled using global data.

It is based on three sources: 1) A GIS modelling using a statistical estimation of peak-flow magnitude and a hydrological model using HydroSHEDS dataset and the Manning equation to estimate river stage for the calculated discharge value. 2) Observed flood from 1999 to 2007, obtained from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory (DFO). 3) The frequency was set using the frequency from UNEP/GRID-Europe PREVIEW flood dataset. In area where no information was available, it was set to 50 years returning period. Unit is expected average number of event per 100 years.
