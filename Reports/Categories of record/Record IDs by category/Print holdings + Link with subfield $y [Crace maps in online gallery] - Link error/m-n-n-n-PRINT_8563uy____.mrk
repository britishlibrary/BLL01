This copy comes from the 1653 edition of John Norden's 'Speculum Britainiae' (literally: 'Mirror of Britain'), re-issued after Norden's death and sold by Peter Stent of Newgate. Around the edges of the map appear the coats of arms of the twelve most influential and wealthy city guilds: the 'Great Liveries'. Guild members became known as liverymen because they wore a distinctive livery or uniform. At top right is the Merchant Tailors company, which made tents and padded tunics during the middle ages. This is reflected by the tent motif on the coat of arms.

This plan was produced to satisfy a European market, and contains certain inaccuracies which a native Londoner would not have tolerated. The streets appear very much wider than they were in actuality. Houses are depicted as having large gardens, when these had, in fact, begun to disappear from London two centuries before. The map details the gap at the north end of London Bridge, caused by a fire in 1632.

The title appears along the top, with the built-up area in the City of London described by stippling, and other built-up areas by crosshatching. The city boundaries are outlined in colour. The map shows the proposed new bridge at Blackfriars, but not the approaches. Designed by Robert Mylne, this third bridge to span the Thames was built between 1760 and 69. The nine semi-elliptical Portland-stone arches were replaced from 1860 to 69 by Cubitt and Carr's present structure of five wrought-iron arches faced with cast iron and a granite pier.

It includes views of London landmarks, such as St James's Palace and St Paul's Cathedral, and the arms of the 12 principal City Companies. Dicey was a map seller rather than a cartographer and much of his work is derivative or reissued from earlier plates. This map states that it is printed according to an "Act of Parliament". This makes reference to the Act passed in 1734 to curb the practice of unacknowledged copying. Thereafter, anyone who breached the new 14-year copyright period would have to hand over their derivative plates to the master of the original, paying 5 shillings for each offending print on the premises.

Between 1751 and 1770 and again from 1784 to 1794, he published maps under his own name or under the imprint of Sayer and Bennett. This is the 11th edition of a map published 14 times over a period of 27 years. During this time Robert Sayer became joined in partnership with John Bennett, with their joint imprint appearing on the third to eighth editions. The area of the city is highlighted in pink. A table of references for churches and public buildings appears below the map. In 1794 Sayers stock was acquired by Robert Laurie who founded the map publishing firm of Laurie & Whittle, with his friend James Whittle.

=500  \\$aMap publisher and print seller Robert Sayer traded from Fleet Street in the latter half of the 18th century, first under his own name, and then under the joint imprint of Sayer& Bennett. This map has four-colour text panels in corners, including information relating to the recent Act for regulating Hackney Coaches. The development of turnpike roads in 1750 saw an increase of wheeled traffic, supplanting rivers as the main medium of transport. The map also features information about new rates for watermen introduced in 1785.The title of the plan states that it has been published as the "Act Directs", a reference to the Copyright Act of 1734, used to curb the high incidence of uncredited copying among mapmakers.

=500  \\$aThis is the second edition of Cross's London Guide, originally published in 1837 and issued four times. The cover title of this edition is 'CROSS'S POCKET PLAN OF LONDON AND STREET DIRECTORY 1844'. Its principal interest lies in its detailing of the expansion of the railways. London's first railway was opened in 1836, running between Bermondsey and Deptford, reducing the average travelling time from an hour to eight minutes. This line was extended to Greenwich and London Bridge, with the extension recorded on the map. By 1841 there were six terminal stations in London, with railways linking London with Birmingham and Southampton. These terminals were set at a distance from the centre of the city, due to fears of street congestion. This map shows the Great Western, Birmingham, Eastern Counties, Blackwall, Southampton and Croydon railways. The intended position of Hungerford Bridge is also shown.

=520  \\$aJohn Rocque developed his surveying talent at a young age, making plans of the great houses and gardens of the nobility. This early experience led to him taking up large-scale surveying, producing plans such as this one of Westminster. Here, Tottenham Court and Marylebone are mostly fields but Westminster has grown sufficiently to demand the construction of a new bridge. Westminster Bridge was opened in 1750 and watermen were paid £25,000 in compensation as the new bridge made them largely redundant. The Chelsea Water Works Company, shown south of Totthill Fields, was set up to improve water supply to Westminster and 'parts adjacent'. The Company were the first to introduce slow sand filtration to purify Thames water.

The narrow streets around Westminster Abbey had long been a dangerous area, with its mixture of criminals, courtiers, pilgrims and the wealthy. This was compounded by the abbey precincts being historically afforded sanctuary from the law. The widening of streets in such areas aimed to disperse the slums and tenements, opening them to light, air and policing. The area covered by this plan is where the modern Victoria Street and Parliament Square would be placed in the 1850s and 60s.

=520  \\$aThe route of the Coronation of King James II in 1685 was lined with His Majesty's Troop of Horses and Regiments of Footguards, represented on this map by groups of circles. At the time there were standing armies of nearly 20,000 men in British kingdoms. The procession moved from Westminster Hall to Westminster Abbey. James converted to Catholicism in 1669, but despite this he succeeded to the throne peacefully at the age of 51. Aiming for religious toleration, James issued the Declaration of Indulgence in 1687. The following year his son, James Stuart, was born to his second wife, the Catholic Mary of Modena, arousing fear that a Roman Catholic dynasty would be established. The Protestant husband of James's elder daughter, William of Orange, invaded on 5 November 1688 and the army and the navy rallied to William, precipitating James' escape to France. James was defeated at the Battle of the Boyne, in Ireland, when he tried to reclaim the throne in 1690. He spent the rest of his life in exile in France, dying there in 1701.

George II's reign was dominated by the Jacobin conflict, and his reign was threatened in 1745 by Charles Edward Stuart, the Young Pretender, who landed in Scotland. The Jacobite threat came to an end when Charles was defeated at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746. The country prospered greatly during George II's reign, with the coal and shipbuilding industries becoming more productive, an overall growth in the population, and the establishment of British control in Madras and Bengal.

=520  \\$aA sketch of individuals and their order in the coronation procession is featured at the top of the page. 60 years as king, George III's was the second longest reign in British history. He was third Hanoverian monarch, but the first to be born in England and use English as his first language. His reign was curtailed by periodic bouts of mental instability,which many contemporary commentators ascribed to the strain of the American conflict,but was more likely caused by the hereditary physical disorder called porphyria. He was a cultured monarch who donated to the nation a royal collection of books as the nucleus of a national library, now held in the King's Tower;in the British Library.

=520  \\$aThis is a proof plan details the procession platform, covered in blue cloth, that led from Westminster Hall to the Abbey and the Coronation Theatre within the Abbey. With 60 years as king, George III had the second longest reign in British history. He was third Hanoverian monarch, but the first to be born in England and use English as his first language. His reign was curtailed by bouts of mental instability, blamed by many contemporary commentators on the strain of the American conflict, but more likely caused by the hereditary physical disorder porphyria. He was a cultured monarch who donated to the nation a collection of books as the nucleus of a national library, now held in the King's Tower in the British Library.

It was in a poor state by the 1780s, and the Prince of Wales commissioned Henry Holland to reconstruct it. Work on the house began in 1783 and continued for 30 years, with neighbouring properties bought and demolished to make way for new wings. This plan shows the extensive walled garden laid out by William Kent along with the ground plots of other houses and stables in Pall Mall and Cockspur Street.

The neighbouring St James Palace, Thatched House, Bridgewater House, York House and other properties on St James's Street are shown with their respective lease-expiry dates. Marlborough House was built for Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough, when Queen Anne granted a 50-year lease on the land adjoining St. James's Palace. The house remained in the Marlborough family until 1817 when it was returned to the Crown. Sir Christopher Wren had originally been commissioned to design the house, but the Duchess of Marlborough, unhappy with his work, took over the project herself. Work on the house started in 1709 and was completed by 1711.

Built in 1586 to replace the Earls of Bedford's earlier mansion on the south side of the Strand, it was demolished in 1706, making way for Southampton Street, Tavistock Street and Tavistock Row. Covent Garden was the metropolitan estate of the Earls and Dukes of Bedford, whose family name was Russell. They later came to own much of Bloomsbury, hence the name of Russell Square.

Historian and biographer John Strype described it in 1720 as 'a place of great resort and trade for the nobility and gentry'.

=520  \\$aA pecked line marks the parish boundary of St Paul's, Covent Carden. Covent Garden was the metropolitan estate of the Russell family: the earls and dukes of Bedford. Bedford House, built in 1586 for the third earl of Bedford, appears to have been an important boundary marker. The development of the area in the 1630s saw it become the first suburb outside the City to be financed by the leasehold system and regulated by building covenants. These factors, combined with Inigo Jones' architecture, made Covent Garden a prototype which was aspired to for the next 250 years.

For example, in St Paul's churchyard is mentioned Marmaduke Conway, who died in 1717 at the age of 108 having never lost a single tooth. It also shows the location of Bedford House, which had been taken down over a century earlier. Around the border of the map are more informative gems, such as the location of a house named 'Two Golden Balls' which in 1711 was famous for magical entertainments.

The area coloured brown was eventually taken from the soap factory to make way for the bridge. The bridge was only known as the Strand Bridge in its infancy. An Act of Parliament changed its name to Waterloo Bridge in 1816 and it was opened by the Prince Regent on 18 June 1817, the second anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.

The plan shows field boundaries, the dimensions of each field, names of tenants and describes different kinds of land use. Paddington remained a predominantly rural area until the end of the 18th century, when the Bishop of London granted the Grand Junction Canal Company permission to extend the canal from Brentford to Paddington. The Paddington Estate Act also allowed developers to start building on the estate.

The plan shows the old British Museum simply marked 'museum', Russell Square, Brunswick Square, Tavistock Square, Nursery Ground are all indicated as green spaces. Bloomsbury square is marked by a pecked line and coloured green. Bedford house has become Bedford Place, constructed in 1801-5 by James Burton. Under the 6th Duke of Bedford the area was developed north and east, principally by James Burton and Thomas Cubitt. The resulting squares became a favourite area for writers and painters.

=520  \\$aThis plan covers the area of the Seven Dials, a street formation of seven streets radiating from a central point. Thomas Neale, Master of the Mint began the development of the complex in 1693. The project was completed around 1710. In 1694 John Evelyn went to see the building work and commented on the star formation radiating from a point marked by a Doric pillar. This pillar was removed in 1773 as it had become a meeting place for criminals, partly due to a false rumour that a large sum of money had been buried at its base. Although intended as a smart residential area, it became the haunt of thieves and street vendors in the 18th and 19th centuries. The building of Shaftsbury Avenue and Charing Cross Road reduced the area to little more than a junction.

It seems that there was intention to colour the plan as the key refers to colours. 'New Prison' is marked just left of the cartouche. Clerkenwell Bridewell was built in 1616 as an overflow for Bridewell and was hence known as 'New Prison'. An additional 'New Prison' was built adjacent to it later in the century to relieve pressure on Newgate.

An interesting feature on this map is Jack Straws House near Highbury. Jack Straw was a leader of one band of rebels who attacked the Treasurer's House at Highbury on June 14, 1381. The Peasants' Revolt over increasing taxation was largely due to the monarchy's prosecution of war against France. Toll gates are also marked in various places.

=520  \\$aThis is an eighteenth-century copy of Sir Christopher Wren's plan for rebuilding London after the great fire destroyed seven-eighths of the city. This reduced plan seems to have been published a number of times. This latest edition has a textual explanation beneath the map. When Wren made his plan for rebuilding he was an Oxford astronomer with comparatively little architectural experience, but he was among the first to present a reconstruction plan after the catastrophe. On this plan the narrow streets which had helped spread the fire are replaced by monumental avenues. The influence of the classical buildings and formal street plans which Wren had studied in Paris are a clear influence. Wren also proposed constructing a Thameside quay from Bridle to the Tower, replacing the ramshackle wooden wharfeside buildings with warehouses. A vignette of 'Thamesis' (a putative river god), a female personification of the city, and London burning in the background have been added to the border. Wren's plan was never used. Perhaps due to his eagerness to produce a plan quickly, he was inaccurate in making his ground plan and did not consider contours adequately. Neither king nor parliament were ever to take it seriously, despite title's the assertion that it was 'unhappily defeated by faction'.

=520  \\$aFrom 1807, the East End was supplied with water pumped from the River Lea at Bow by the East London Waterworks Company. This was not, however, the continuous flow of water we take for granted today. Dr John Simon wrote, in 1849, of the thousands who 'wholly depend on their power of attending at some fixed hour of the day, pail in hand, beside the nearest stand-cock; where, with their neighbours, they wait their turn; sometimes not without a struggle, during the tedious dribbling of a single small pipe. Household rubbish was piled into heaps in the street and outdoor toilets drained into cesspits. The survey of sanitation in Bethnal Green made by Hector Gavin in 1848 paints a sorry picture. Knightly Court was typical of the streets he visited: 'In it there are two privies in a beastly state, full, and the contents overflowing into the court. There is one dust reservoir. One stand-tap supplies the seven houses; two cases of severe typhus lately occurred here, one died. ' This map of 1843 shows the distribution of sewers through the East End. They carried only surface water, contaminated with decayed rubbish from the streets and excrement from overflowing cesspits, and discharged it directly into the Thames - from which water companies pumped their drinking water.

After a Parliamentary Select Committee in 1796 condemned the congestion at the Port of London, a number of large-scale projects for new docking and shipping facilities were submitted to Parliament. Fairburn's plan illustrates the London merchants' scheme. It consists of an entrance dock that could accommodate 33 loaded ships, two main docks that would accommodate a total of 355 ships and a separate dock for lighters. The plan also included the creation of the 2' 3/4 mile long cut from Wapping to Blackwall. An improved version of this scheme would eventually materialise as the London Docks.

An explanatory note appears in panel below the plan. Alexander's original design included a 20-acre St. Georges Dock to the west and a seven-acre Shadwell Dock to the east. Both would have their own basins, and be linked by a small Tobacco Dock. Opened in 1805, London Docks were the nearest to the city and for 21 years all imports of tobacco, rice, wine and brandy (except those from the East and West Indies) had to unload there.

This is the second edition of this map, Updated and issued in 1669 with a dedication to Sir William Turner, The Lord Mayor of London for that year. The map's title appears along the top of the manuscript, With the City arms and dedication at top centre. The key to buildings destroyed in the fire appears in a table at top right, With a compass star at bottom right, Scale bar and imprint at bottom left, And an illustration of the city on fire inset at top left. The location of livery halls destroyed in the fire is indicated by their respective coats of arms. Letters identify individual City wards, With ward boundaries indicated by a pecked line. Buildings outside the city walls, Undamaged by the fire, Are represented three dimensionally.

It appeared in a book by Francesco Velagio entitled 'Raccolta di le piu illustri et famose citta di tutto il mondo'.

Under different jurisdiction than the City of London, Westminster had developed during the middle ages into a centre of royal administration. Along the Strand are the former residences of the Bishops deposed at the Reformation. By the late 16th century, these properties were in the hands of the Queen's courtiers, statesmen and other people of influence.

The present-day Covent Garden is an area of fields named "Convent Garden", indicating that the area belonged to the Abbey of St Peter's at Westminster before the dissolution of monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII. The location of Tower Bridge is marked, although the actual bridge was not planned until 1879. This indicates that Londoners were thinking about bridging the river at this point one hundred years before the decisive plan to do so.

=500  \\$aThis map has been attributed to Augustus Ryther, an engraver who prospered between 1572 and 1592, contributing to Saxton's Atlas of 1579. This plan was produced to satisfy a European market, and contains certain inaccuracies which a native Londoner would not have tolerated. The streets appear very much wider than they were in actuality. Houses are depicted as having large gardens, when these had, in fact, begun to disappear from London two centuries before. Due to the scarcity of maps of London this rather misleading map was printed several times. This is the second edition. The map-seller's imprint has been removed and a large compass rose has been inserted. The Globe playhouse has been omitted on this edition, because of the theatre's destruction in 1644. Hoge Lane, Bedlam and Finsbury Fields have also been added. The map is shows the water conduit near Fleet Bridge, an important link in the water supply line from St Pancras.

Jean Covens and Corneil Mortier founded the prestigious printing and publishing house that bears their names in Amsterdam in 1721.

The panorama of the city which features in the panel below the plan is based on Matthaeus Merian's view published in "Theatrum Europeum" in 1720. Joannes de Ram had already published an identical map of the city.

An engraver by trade, Thomas Bowles acquired the stock of cartographers Morden & Lea at the beginning of the 18th century, starting a successful publishing house, the output of which was almost entirely derivative. Bowles' brother, John, was also a print seller and publisher. Their businesses were separate, but the two often worked together.

No new survey of the London area had been made between William Morgan's in 1682 and John Rocque's of 1746. The marked similarity of this map to the William Roades' 1731 pocket map is testimony to this. The title of this drawing appears in a square tablet at top left, with prominent buildings shown pictorially.

A territory with its own courts and administration, the Duchy of Lancaster was created in 1267 by Edward III for his younger son John. The Duchy was attached to the Crown when Prince Henry of Bolingbroke, the last Duke of Lancaster, became Henry IV in 1399. To this day, the Duchy has retained its own jurisdiction under the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The chancellorship is a high governmental position, and sometimes a cabinet post. Since, for at least the last two centuries, the Chancellor rarely has had any significant duties pertaining to the Duchy's management, he is usually available as a minister without portfolio. Recent Chancellors have included Labour cabinet minister Mo Mowlam.

=500  \\$aThis is the third edition of William Faden's 1787 map, which was printed 11 times over a period of 25 years. Faden called himself "Geographer to the King", and was very interested the work of the Ordnance Survey. In 1800 he published 'An account of the operations carried on for accomplishing a trigonometrical survey of England and Wales'. Faden's skill as a cartographer was so well-noted that his map of 'The Country Twenty-Five Miles round London' was re-engraved for the French War Department in preparation for an invasion of England. This map includes a list of Surrey Parishes within the Bills of Mortality, an area of 109 parishes in and near London from which a weekly report of deaths was collated. Westminster is divided into 12 districts, each indicated by coloured boundaries.
=500  \\$aFirst printed in 1787; later ed. with year in title altered to 1789, 1790 (this state), 1797, 1801, 1802, 1803, 1805, 1807, 1812 and 1815.

It includes a list of the receiving houses appointed by the General and Penny Post Offices and a table of Hackney coach fares. The postal service in London was largely developed by William Dockwra, who responded to the demand for local letter delivery in London: non-existent until 1680, except by private messenger. Dockwra opened nearly 500 receiving houses where letters were sorted for delivering, costing the user one penny. So successful was this system that it was taken over by the General Post Office after two years.

Differences between this edition and the previous one suggest that the plate was re-engraved, at least in part, as new and proposed buildings have been added. Most strikingly, 20 proposed locations for fire stations are depicted, along with their catchment areas. The Metropolitan Fire Brigade was not formed until 1865. A number of different company brigades had co-operated with each other as the London Fire Engine Establishment since 1833. The failure of this service to stop the destruction of the Houses of Parliament in 1837 led to criticism, increasing when a fire in Tooley Street raged for two days.

This edition includes an inset plan of the proposed Wet Docks.

The result was a number of project proposals for the building of new docks. However, none of these proposals were carried out, and the problem was not solved until private companies began building enclosed docks in 1802.

Each would have its own basin, and be linked by a small Tobacco Dock.

It indicates with a dotted line the proposed new bridge at Waterloo. Designed by John Rennie, Waterloo Bridge was constructed by a commercial company hoping to profit from toll-paying traffic. The bridge cost £1 million and was never profitable. In 1936, amid controversy, the bridge was demolished and replaced.

=500  \\$aThe title of this map of London and suburbs appears at top left, with the key to symbols and abbreviations at the top right and a compass rose at the bottom centre. The map is divided into mile squares with borders marked off in furlongs for reference. Squares, open spaces and city boundaries are distinguished in colour. This is a later edition of a map first issued in 1804, updated to include the new bridges and the approaches at Waterloo and Vauxhall (indicated by dotted lines). Built between 1809 and 1819, Vauxhall, Waterloo and Southwark bridges were projected, funded and constructed by private commercial companies hoping to profit from toll-paying traffic from Lambeth, Camberwell and the rest of south London.

The map is chiefly drawn from the Ordnance Survey, the railroads and the other improvements from the official copies and the Borough of Marylebone from the survey published by Mr Britton. The whole corrected from personal observations and measurements. Borough and county boundaries are highlighted in colour, with principal roads represented in yellow.

The city boundary is marked in red, with open land, such as parks and gardens, in green, and the Thames, docks and canals in blue. The map clearly labels the contemporary development of the railway lines, with the Birmingham railway shown intersecting the Regent's Canal at Camden Town. The canal, enthusiastically promoted by architect John Nash, was built to facilitate the import of goods from the provinces. Constructed at the beginning of the era of sustained railway development, however, it never fulfilled its potential and became obsolete.

Marc Brunel, father of the great engineer Isobard, solved the problem of how to bore through soft ground or under water, inventing the tunnelling shield. Both father and son worked on the tunnel which was completed as a foot tunnel in 1843, before becoming a railway tunnel for the East London Railway in the 1860s.

=500  \\$aThe cholera outbreaks of the 1830s and 1840s forced the government to make drastic improvements to the methods of drainage and sewage disposal in London. A Metropolitan Commission of Sewers was charged with the central task of unifying the existing piecemeal drainage system and forming a plan for a completely new one. A new map showing the levels of the land to be drained was needed for this. In March 1848, officers of the Royal Engineers began to prepare stations for triangulation. Observation posts were set up on one of the towers of Westminster Abbey and over the cross of St Paul's. This map is the result of the survey, showing the relative altitude of the land, a necessary preamble to planning drainage systems, as sewage can only be washed away downhill.

Only main roads in the capital are shown on this map and London locations are marked by small medallions containing scenes. Borders of roundels contain people from "all nations".

The plan's title features in square tablet at top right, with scale bar at bottom centre and a key to towers, chapels and streets in panel at top left. The term 'liberties' refers to the area under the Tower's independent jurisdiction. Until 1686, the liberties of the Tower were restricted to the area within its walls and the land on Tower Hill. Three territories were added by James II's charter of 1686: the Minories, the Artillery Ground and the Wellclose.
