=505  00$aRussel Porter, an Australian documentary filmmaker examines how people in Cuba are surviving the hardships caused initially by the "blockade" imposed by the USA over 30 years ago and increased by the more recent loss of trade with the countries of Eastern Europe. The goal was to faithfully and objectively portray the current atmosphere and character of this "little island in the Caribbean."

=505  00$aAdd & Mabel's Punkin Center is about memories. It's about the urge to collect things from the past to help make vivid those cherished times. But it's also about today, about two old-timers whose tender and jovial banter reveals a contentment with the present derived only from knowing their past.To experience Punkin Center in Southern Indiana is to experience the value of reminiscence. Today, we see a homespun folk museum filled with hundreds of thousands of antiques and curiosities Add and Mabel Gray have collected since the 1920s. Each item inspires stories about vaudeville acts and organ grinders, Kraft cheese parties and western swing, Depression days and Amish neighbors. Over the years, Punkin Center grew to become the hub - the true backbone of their Midwestern community, fulfilling a need for isolated rural folk to be in touch with each other and the rest of the world.

=505  00$aTunde Jegede, a black musician and composer, bridges two classical traditions. His instrument is the Kora, an African harp lute whose roots are in the court of 13th century Mali. First introduced to the Kora in Britain by a Senegalese musician, Tunde later studied in the Gambia where he found himself immersed in its rich oral tradition. In this film, we follow him to the villages of West Africa where he learns from local musicians. We also see him perform his compositions with the London Sinfonietta. What is remarkable about Tunde's music is the way it combines West African and classical European traditions, bringing together a love of both cultures. Combining African experiences with Western structures, spontaneous composition with written musical notation, his "The Cycle of Reckoning" reflects on the legacy of the African slave trade.

=505  00$aWine has been made in the Western Cape region of South Africa for over 300 years. At first, slaves and indigenous Khoisan worked the vineyards owned by white European settlers. Classified as "Coloureds," the descendants of these laborers have continued to work these vineyards for generations. Until recently, they could not own the houses they lived in, and were paid for their labor partly in alcohol. This instituted form of abuse - called the dop system - was designed by wine farm owners to encourage alcohol dependency in their workers so that they would not leave the farm to look for work elsewhere.

=520  3\$aGeoffrey O'Connor, the filmmaker of Contact and At The Edge of Conquest has produced this fascinating chronicle of recent political events in the Brazilian Amazon. Beginning with the assassination of Chico Mendes in 1988 and ending with a return trip to Yanomami Territory in 1995, this six year journey provides an illuminating perspective on the volatile changes of this era. Besides documenting events, O'Connor analyzes the complex interaction between semi-isolated indigenous societies and "outsiders." In collaboration with Brazilian anthropologist Alcida Ramos, he explores the return of the "noble savage phenomena", wherein outsiders created misleading illusions about Indian societies. This cultural confusion explains many of the region's tragic events. This insightful look at the Amazon includes exclusive sequences of the events surrounding the massacre of a village of Yanomami Indians, the demarcation of Kayapo Territory, and the rock star Sting's frank assessment of his own involvement in rain forest politics. This new release from a veteran observer of the Amazon scene sheds new light on cultural confrontation.

=505  00$aAmerican FairAmerican Fair is an intimate study of the hard-working farmers of York County, Maine, facing a vanishing way of life, their knowledge of land and beast, commitment to tradition and community - interdependent and pulling together.At the 140th fair in Acton, farmers congregate in the spirit of both co-operation and rivalry. Families show off their finest handicrafts, agricultural produce and livestock. Teamsters compete to see whose animal is the strongest and whose daughter the most beautiful. Through the voices of farmers and townspeople, vendors and carnival workers, a portrait of a community joining together in celebration of the honest, hard-working agricultural traditions of the region is revealed. Fathers and sons, knowledge of land and beast, carnival workers and strange stories, country girls, ox-pulling, dairy showing, beauty pageants, a pig scramble and more! This feature-length ethnographic documentary quietly reveals the agricultural heritage of the region and opens our eyes to a wholesome side of American culture - as people of the earth.

=505  00$aSome animals have always fascinated mankind for their mystery and power. Elephants, crocodiles, snakes, apes, big cats and sharks are feared as enemies in some cultures and admired as super beings in others.Whether part of our nightmares or greatest hopes, this fascination has pushed man to want to confront these great animals and has given birth to surprising legends and beliefs that still haunt us today.Impressive rituals, ceremonies and combat scenes are gathered into six incredible stories that explain the bond between tribal animals and human kind and why they are so present in our imaginations.

Upon retirement, Golay became a full-time toy maker. Even as a watchmaker, he used to make toys for his own children.The film follows his steps as he builds a toy hand-cart, from raw wood to finished product. We also see his collection of toys, which are reduced-scale models of all the carts, wheel barrows and other implements used on the farm before the invention of the tractor.

=505  00$aAt the Edge of Conquest looks at the situation of the Waiapi Indians, a small, isolated tribe that came in contact with the outside world in the late 1970's. Today they are threatened by invading gold miners, by the Brazilian government's recent proposal to reduce their land by 10%, and the state government's plan to construct a highway directly through their territory. But their strategy for survival has been effective: defend their lands from invasions while their leaders navigate the tricky waters of Brazilian politics. The film focuses on the charismatic leader, Chief Wai-Wai, as he travels from his remote village to Brazil's capitol, encountering for the first time airplanes, elevators, and skyscrapers. But the real barriers are not physical but bureaucratic and cultural. He doesn't read or write, has never been at a meeting before, and doesn't speak the language of these foreign people. Unlike the traditional depictions of indigenous persons as pristine, removed from the forces of the outside world, At the Edge of Conquest reveals a society grappling with the real politique of a larger nation-state. Chief Wai-Wai is fighting the role of victim in a desperate effort to shape the destiny of his people. It is a voyage resembling a cross between Alice in Wonderland and a Kafkaesque nightmare. But it is one which ultimately all isolated indigenous societies are forced to make if they are to survive this rapidly changing world.

The next day a polar bear is seen basking in the warming sun. A woman lights her seal oil lamp, carefully forming the wick from moss. The man repairs his snow goggles. Another man arrives dragging a polar bear skin. The boy has made a bear-shaped figure from snow and practices throwing his spear. Then he tries his bow. Now, with her teeth, the woman crimps the sole of a sealskin boot she is making.

The wind disturbs the "tell-tales," made of eider down or a hair loop on a bone, that signal when a seal rises to breathe. A hunter strikes, kills and drags his catch up and away. At the igloo the woman scrapes at a polar bear skin and a man repairs a sled. In the warming weather the igloo is topped with furs and a snow shelter is built to hide the sled from the sun. Now a seal is skinned, the polar bear skin pegged out to dry, and the people stop for a snack of good red fish from the cache.

He kills it by crushing the skull with his foot, leaving the skin undamaged. Skirting bare ground, he comes to a fish cache and loads his sled, feeding the dogs some morsels. The sled appears to drag, even on the harder snow of the sea ice. In camp a woman sews, a girl hangs fish on a line, and all stop to eat. Now the disintegrating skin sled is dismantled and the polar bear skin serves for conveyance. They break camp, moving ashore to put up their tents for summer.

=505  00$aIn late winter when the cold is severe, the people and dogs are glad to stop their trek and make camp. In the blue dusk the men probe the snow and then cut building blocks while the women shovel a site. Soon all are under cover, and in the wavering light of the stone lamp they sleep, their breath rising coldly. In the light of day the men test and refurbish their spears, harness dogs to the sled and strike out on the sea ice. Each man, with a dog or two, explores the white waste, seeking scent of a seal's breathing hole. When a dog noses the snow, the man probes for the hole and, when he finds it, suspends a single looped hair to signal when the seal rises to breathe. Then he waits, motionless, to make his strike. He kills, and the others gather to taste the warm liver of his catch. Then, as night comes, the vigil goes on.

=505  00$aWork begins on a big community igloo, and all share in the building of it; one cuts, one carries, one builds, and so on. The children imitate. Women pile snow on the igloo, tossing it up from shovel to shovel. Ice sheets are installed for light. The men return to their sealing and the women to duties or play. In the large living space of the igloo, activities are easy to see. An infant uses the sharp ulu as confidently as any adult to cut bite-size meat or fish. A game of blind man's bluff begins between women and children. This is followed by spear-the-peg, where a toggle-sized peg is suspended and players with baton-sized spears attempt to strike the hole in the peg as it turns. Now fish is sliced and eaten. In the blue dusk, the snow smokes over the ice, and the men come home. A man drags in a seal and a woman sucks on ice and then drips the water into the mouth of a dead animal. The flesh is then divided, with each woman carrying away some in sealskin bags. The dogs enter to clean up, and the men then try their games of strength.

=505  00$aA bitter wind blows and the dogs huddle in the snow. In the igloo, the children scratch in the rime on the ice window. A man takes out his tool-pouch and drills the stone trough he is making, using bow and spindle. Children play with a pup; a man coils his whip and warms his hands at the lamp. A naked infant toddles by. A woman presses blubber in the lamp to free the oil, and a child carries the sharpening rock to the man who saws at his stonework. Outside, the boys stand on their heads and roll in drifting snow. A woman has a speck of rock in her eye and the carver removes it by opening wide the eye and applying his lips. The men gamble at the spear-the-peg game. The women try another spear-the-peg game. Some men are still at the seal hunt, beards rimed by the cold. Day ends with a drum performance to which the women sing. The next day the big igloo is deserted and the people are again trekking over the broad expanse of the sea ice.

It is based on anthropological research conducted over twenty years and reveals how the weavers make textiles encoded with symbolic images that reinforce ancestral beliefs during rituals and in everyday life. Four Quechua people's stories are told against a backdrop of high Andean lakes and mountains showing a harsh existence possible only through a strong symbiotic relationship to their alpacas and llamas.

=505  00$aIn Brazil, it is said that a pregnant woman has one foot in her grave. Young mothers depend on traditional midwives who accompany them through the storm of birth giving thanks to their ancestral knowledge which they humbly describe as a "gift from god"."Baby Catchers of the Amazon" is an intimate and moving portrait of Dona Dorca and Dona Ilda, who welcome life and confront death in a place where the very continuation of life often relies on their leathery hands.

=505  00$aIn Bali Beyond The Postcard, art and everyday life come together in an intimate story about a Balinese family whose gamelan music and Legong dance tradition spans four generations. The documentary follows an important event in the history of the family - the passing down of the Legong dance legacy to the youngest, a nine-year-old member of the family. From the first rehearsal taught by the mother to the final debut presided over by the family's ninety-year-old patriarch and gamelan master, the filmmakers capture the intensity with which tradition evolves and is passed on in Bali. The result is an intimate view into a dynamic culture steeped in ancient traditions and increasingly exposed to the modern world.

Farmers like the Hern‡ndez family, who lived by the river, went on working their fields and tending to their livestock. On the evening of May 20, 18-year-old Esequiel Hernández Jr. left the house to tend to his family's goats, taking with him, as usual, a .22 rifle to keep away wild dogs. It was the last evening of his life.

=505  00$aUntil it was conquered by the British in 1897, the city of Benin, in what is now Nigeria, was the centre of a powerful kingdom. Its rulers, the Obas of Benin, were mysterious, secluded figures who spent much of their time in the performance of rituals designed to enhance their power and to ensure the prosperity of their subjects. Many of the art objects for which Benin is famous were used in these rituals, some of which are still performed.This film shows some of the most significant moments in the rituals that take place around the beginning of the new year, including the greatest event of the ritual year, the Igwe Festival, in which the Obas divine powers are strengthened and renewed. The object of worship is the head of the living Oba, the seat of his ritual energy, on which the well-being of the nation is believed to depend on.

=520  3\$aThis classic film documents the Hmong refugees who have been transplanted from their agrarian mountain villages in northern Laos to cities in the U.S. Often living in high-rise tenements, they bring their ancient shamanic rituals and ceremonies to urban America. In such unlikely settings, trance-like healing and animal offerings are practiced as they were back home. The documentary captures rare and dramatic footage of the Hmong buying and sacrificing a cow in rural Illinois to save a sick baby in a metropolitan hospital. It shows the attempts of a missionary to convert a traditional Hmong family. It also explores an unexplained phenomenon (SUNDS) in which young Hmong men have died in their sleep for no apparent medical cause. Anthropologist Dwight Conquergood, well-known for his work with the Hmong, points out the similarity between their beliefs and those of the Native Americans.

=505  00$aBedouin of the deserts of Arabia and the Middle East have developed a system of law and order called Haj El Orfi - The Law of Knowledge - which evolved from their harsh environment and has been passed down orally for generations. The Bisha ceremony is the ultimate ordeal for revealing the truth. Suspects lick a white-hot iron pan with their tongues. If they are scorched, it shows they are lying: if not, they have unequivocally proven their innocence. This film tells the stories of three individuals who choose to undergo the Bisha. One has been accused of handing over a tribesman to the Israeli Secret Service. One has been accused of murder, and one woman has been accused of adultery for which the penalty is death. She maintains her innocence and undergoes the Bisha in order to save her life. We watch them attempt to vindicate themselves through this awesome ritual. Bisha is a riveting exploration of this unusual custom. The film also delves into other aspects of Bedouin culture -- the role of honored elders, the exorcism of demons, rituals of mystic sects, and other practices of the Bedouin law system.

They attach great importance to the traditional role of women in a herding society and perform dawn to dusk tasks with little deviation from customary ways. Remarkable though is the obvious independence they demonstrate in performing tasks which normally would fall under the male domain, like building their own houses.

=505  00$aThe United Nations peace keeping force in Bosnia included soldiers from nations and cultures that did not know where Bosnia was, or what the conflict was about. Among them was a force from Kenya which included several Samburu warriors. Bosnia Hotel films these warriors after their return to their ancestral land. It shows their present life as cattle herders on the African plain. They tell of their experience in the "white man's war."In many ways, their confusion about what was going on between the Serbs, Bosnians and Croats was not very different from many in the Western world who had full access to news reports. Why were neighbors killing one another, and why were women and children being killed? By "turning the tables", the indigenous people get to speak of their impression of the white man's civilization... a place where people blow one another up with explosives without "even seeing their faces." If all the people were white, they ask why did they have such differences that could only be resolved in devastation. The film juxtaposes Samburu practices that are looked upon askance by "civilized" people -- animal sacrifice, the ritual drinking of blood from the freshly slaughtered animal, and circumcision of adolescent males-- with the warrior's observations of the white man's world in which, though there was much progress, neighbor killed neighbor and many large houses were shattered. The warriors earned money and now have material aspirations, but they still maintain their traditions. Theirs is a society with strong communal ties and deep faith. In the end, one warrior says of Bosnia, "it's a country much different than ours, but no better or worse." One wonders.

=505  00$aIn the late 19th century, the Canadian government removed ritual objects from the possession of the Kwakiut'l, a Native American community on the Northwest Coast. The 'potlatch', as it was called, was their way of celebrating their culture, their identity and their heritage. A ritual passing down of treasures, it symbolized a rebirth of tradition, a positive affirmation of their identity, past and present. In 1921 the Kwakiut'l people of Alert Bay, British Columbia, held their last secret potlatch. In 1980 at Alert Bay, the U'mista Cultural Centre (U'mista means "something of great value that has come back") opened its doors to receive and house the cultural treasures which were seized decades earlier and only then returned to the people.

=505  00$aIn the Haitian countryside, where people have little access to doctors, hospitals, or conventional medicine, peasants have learned to use local leaves, herbs, and therapeutic massage as a way of curing simple ailments. This video follows several men and women as they take us into the bush to look for leaves that they need for healing. We then follow then home where they explain and demonstrate their way of preparing the poultice or infusion. Narrated by the people themselves -and with beautiful songs about the importance of leaves woven throughout - this poetic film gives unique insight into the culture.

=505  00$aBrujo is an exploration of shamanism and curing among the Mazatec Indians of Oaxaca, Mexico, and among two groups of Maya Indians in southern Mexico and Guatemala. The film is divided into three sequences. The first, filmed in Chichicastenango (Guatemala), shows Diego, a shaman, cure a woman on whom a spell has been cast. The cure takes place partly in a church and partly in the mountains, where a sacrificed chicken is used to bring back the ailing woman's spirit.The second sequence moves to Oaxaca, where a Mazatec shaman, her husband, and her patient consume hallucinogenic mushrooms. The cure, which takes place in darkness, involves a simple song (the mushroom's "voice") and dance, flowers, and the rubbing of tobacco on both the patient and the shaman's husband.The final sequence takes place in the Chiapas highlands of Mexico, site of the festival and film Tajimoltik. The filmmakers encounter shaman Miguel, who brings them to his family home in a mountain hamlet beyond Chenalho. There he undertakes to cure filmmaker Claudine Viallon of a migraine, using candles, eggs, and incense. Miguel also discusses conceptions of the soul, death, and transmigration.

=505  00$aThe films were made in the Anthropology Department of San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University at Northridge). Edmund Carpenter founded the department with the intention of moving anthropology beyond the book. He felt that the realities and insights of anthropology were often better represented in the arts than in scholarly texts and between 1957 and 1967 he led a flourishing and experimental department. In addition to cultural anthropologists, physical anthropologists and linguists, his faculty included folklorist Bess Lomax Hawes along with artists, musicians, animators and filmmakers.

=505  00$aNow it is July - summer. The run-off is in full spate and open water shows offshore. Ice cakes melt on the shingle. On the bay are ducks. It is time to build a kayak, a task shared by two men. They gather materials: valuable scraps of wood, bone, seal skins and sinews. Now there is much cutting, fitting, joining and binding. The woman helps by cutting additional thongs, scraping skins, providing food. She must also amuse the child who seems left out by the single-minded work of the men. Then the work breaks and a man harpoons a fish in a tide pool; all share the pleasure of fresh food.

These issues have never been more important to our future than they are in now in our globally-conscious, post-911 world. Made by the anthropologist/filmmaking team of Ivo Strecker and Alula Pankhurst, Bury the Spear! focuses on the 1993 peace-making efforts of the Abore, Borana, Konso, Tsamai, Hamar and Dasanach to end decades of ethnic war in the southern Ethiopian Rift Valley.

Jan's struggle to live close to nature is hampered by centuries of colonial exploitation of the San Bushmen and of their land. Unable to survive as they once did hunting and gathering, the Khomani now live in a state of poverty that threatens to see the last of this community forever.One plant could make all the difference. Hoodia, a cactus used by Bushmen for centuries, has caught the attention of a giant pharmaceutical company. It now stands to decide the fate of the Khomani San.

=520  3\$aThe San people, more commonly known as Bushmen, are believed to be the earliest inhabitants of southern Africa. They have lived for 80,000 years as hunter-gatherers in the Kalahari Desert, and are well-known for their expert survival skills in a harsh environment. Their unique clicking languages and their astonishing method of healing through trance dancing have made them a source of worldwide fascination. But these peaceful people have long faced pressures from dominant tribes and European settlers. Recently, cattle ranches, diamond mines and other projects have confined the San to a small portion of the land they once freely roamed. Having been forcibly evicted from their last remaining homeland and relocated into settlements, they must depend on governmental and outside aid. In spite of these challenges, the Bushmen have now begun to stand up for their heritage, their land and their dignity. They have realized that they can benefit economically from their distinctive knowledge and cultural traditions by organizing cultural safaris and selling their indigenous arts and crafts. They are engaged in a legal battle to recover a small portion of their native homeland in the Kalahari. The film takes a unique look at the fascinating history, brutal struggles and the daunting challenges the Bushmen face in the 21st century.

=505  00$aA strange landscape in the middle of the Greek mountains. The silhouettes of furnaces emerge from the hazy and smoke-dappled light. Charcoal-makers, who come sometimes from distant places with their families, are burning wood to make charcoal. They rent their services out to contractors during the five or six summer months. Verging on the poetic, the film describes the difficult and archaic process of charcoal-making in a modern world.

It begins by briefly discussing the precipitous drop in wild populations as well as some of the history of Jane Goodall's research at Gombe, focusing on the discoveries that promoted the use of the chimpanzee model in studying human evolution. It then covers many situations chimpanzee captivity, including the sanctuaries in Africa set up for infant chimpanzees rescued from poachers and some of the zoo habitats in which they are held.

=520  3\$aMusically stunning and emotionally compelling this film follows a group of Latina musicians as they break the gender barrier to perform mariachi music in America with passion and gusto. Long the purview of male musicians, the 12 member Mariachi Reyna de Los Angeles was the first all female mariachi band. Since their inception in 1994, other female groups have been formed who perform professionally, expanding the popularity of the music, which is an important part of their cultural heritage. Along with a brief history of mariachi music, the film interweaves portraits of the women who often find their personal lives conflict with their desire to be full-time musicians. The issues raised are universal to women everywhere: how to balance family life with career, how to achieve equal pay, and how to deal with emotional conflict. Companeras offers rich material for discussion as well as engaging performances!

=505  00$aMade for the United Nations, this documentary chronicles the logging damage that has taken place in the forests of Finnish Lapland over the past 50 years. Home to the indigenous Saami peoples, these Northern old growth forests are essential to Saami reindeer herding, a traditional way of life that the Saami hope to continue into future generations. Population growth in Finland has created economic pressure - prompting migration to the Saami lands in the North. The resulting forest cutting severely depletes the lichen necessary for free reindeer grazing, and logging infrastructure disrupts the entire forest ecosystem.

=505  00$aThis documentary, shot in one of the most remote corners of the Brazilian Amazon, graphically depicts the devastating impact of contact with the outside world on an isolated indigenous tribe, the Yanomami Indians. They are considered to be the last major Stone Age people in the Amazon. Since 1987, as the result of the incursion of Brazilian gold miners, an estimated fifteen percent of the Yanomami Indians have died from malaria and related diseases to which they have little resistance. Further, the mining operations have polluted rivers and scared away game animals thereby destroying the Yanomami's traditional ecosystem. Although the Brazilian government is ostensibly trying to protect the Indians, such efforts are undermined by the fact that their mineral-rich ancestral land is coveted by mining interests. This frontier section of the Brazilian Amazon is labeled a national security zone and off limits to all unauthorized persons, including anthropologists. Producer Geoffrey O'Connor was smuggled into Yanomami territory so that he could record the plight of these endangered peoples. A closed captioned version is available on vhs only. Please specify when ordering.

=505  00$aThis is an innovative, intimate portrait of stalwart members of an indigenous people who inhabit Mexico's Sierra de Santa Marta and speak a derivative of ancient Olmec. For convenient classroom use, eight episodes, focused on various aspects of their culture, have been divided into Parts I and II -- available separately.Part I begins with recollections of an outlawed carnival celebration intercut with old women performing "Dance of the Tiger" in honor of the corn god. Episode two: younger women collaborate, guided by Santana, in making a fuel-saving clay stove. Episode three moves to Apolinar¹s clinic for a group-cleansing, followed by his recital of a chant to restore a soul stolen by wiley spirits called chanecos. In section four, Santana recounts her life-story.Part II begins with Don Tomas pouring libations to the rain god. Episode six find us in a polygamous household. Episode seven dramatizes the popular story of Homshuk, the corn god, as Gabriel and his second wife labor in the fields. To conclude, the Arizmendi brothers revive ballads of the Sierra on homemade instruments.

Widely shared are moments evoking laughter, shock and remarkably intense, thoughtful reflection. Holy Hustlers is moving, local viewers agree. But while welcoming that - it is seen to be a documentary that appeals to people in Botswana - they disagree, when asked about the reasons for their responses; and they argue about characters, scenes and the very nature of representation in Holy Hustlers.The screenings elicit contradictory interpretations. These are expressed by some subjects of the film, by University of Botswana staff, students and the invited public, and by activists of two youth organisations, YOHO (Youth Health Organisation) and YIAS (Youth in Action Society).

Man however, lived in perfect harmony with them, thanks to a sacred alliance he concluded with the marine mammals.Today however, throughout the world, exist ethnic minorities whose daily lives continue to bear witness to contemporary myths : these legends are their faith, and the animals, their gods.From the shark tamers of the Pacific to the crocodile hunters of the Australian reef, "Sea legends" reveals the most wondrous of beliefs which unite man and nature in the spectacular, thousand-year old fulfillment of a magical destiny.

=505  00$aThis fascinating film is about two unique individuals, a French Catholic priest and an English Protestant nun and the powerful influence of Buddhism on both of them. Father Francois Ponchaud, a published author, writes on Cambodian politics and history and speaks fluent Khmer with Cambodian villagers. Mother Rosemary leads a life of silence and prayer in a convent in Oxford. Yet both the active missionary priest and the contemplative Mother Superior practice Buddhist meditation. For Father Ponchaud, who lost nearly all his students in the Cambodian "killing fields," meditation sustains him in the face of tragedy, as well as in everyday life. For Mother Rosemary, this meditation lent support to her life of prayer when "prayer seemed to go dead." In the era of globalization, when human ventures and ideas are being thrown together an unprecedented rate, Father Ponchaud and Mother Rosemary point a way forward both for institutional religions and for seekers of truth outside the confines of convention. They shed light on the character of Jesus Christ, the path of the Buddha and the call to holiness. They demonstrate that it is possible to retain deep roots in one tradition while being profoundly enriched by another.

=505  00$aEach summer for the past one hundred years, local residents on an otherwise tranquil block in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn turn their lives upside down for two weeks in order to host the reenactment of a centuries-old religious pageant.The annual feast of San Paulino di Nola has its roots in an archaic fertility rite with exotic pagan undertones. Italians from the Campanese village of Nola, who emigrated to Williamsburg in the 1880's, brought their blessed saint statues, fig trees and traditional values to New York. Soon after they arrived to a new world of stoops and storefronts, they formed a special "society," dedicated to maintaining the annual feast of their hometown saint in their new-world neighborhood.But what makes this display so spectacular is an 85-foot, 3-ton obelisk known as the Giglio, which, along with a full brass band and church pastor, is hoisted on the shoulders of 100 neighborhood men and carried aloft through the streets. The blocks-long procession provokes many moods, alternating between reflective piety and frenzied hysteria, around which fireworks are set off and everyone receives a fertility blessing.Da Feast! celebrates a very special day in the life of the Giglio, on its 100th anniversary in the streets of Williamsburg. While the intimate documentary features the neighborhood's dynamic young priest, Father Fonti; the ceremony's Capo Paranza, Phil Galasso; an appearance by Brooklyn's colorful Borough president, Marty Markowitz; and a swinging original jazz score by Joe Magnarelli, the real star is filmmaker (and Williamsburg resident) Artemis Willis' 96-year-old landlord, Massimino - who built the Giglio in Italy and brought his craft and his soul to Brooklyn.More than a block party or a church social, the Feast continues to unfold on personal, political, communal, familial, and cosmic levels in this constantly changing community. Today, zeppole carts are likely to stand adjacent to henna tattoo parlors, and the area's young hipsters observe a lesson in community from the local Italian Americans, and they both embrace a soundtrack that ranges from ancient folksongs to "Gonna Fly Now" (the theme from Rocky).

=505  00$aThis film is an invitation to see Javanese palace dancing as performed in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and to go beyond appearances to discover what the dance means to those who continue the tradition. In this film dancers prepare to entertain guests at a wedding reception and perform the Love Dance (Langen Nawung Asmara). The female dancer, Susindahati, becomes the centre of attention as she does her household duties and then goes to the Secondary School of Performing Arts for classes in teaching theory and practical training in the Golek Asmarandana dance. Susindahati's generation is concerned with the perfecting of technical mastery. It is the older generation who can explain the importance of dance as a discipline, and the ideas associated with it. One of the connoisseurs, R. Kawindrasusena (known as Pak Seno), reads part of a philosophical text in the macapat style, and explains the spiritual elements of palace dance in Yogyakarta. At a training session of the Yayasan Siswa Among Beksa dance association, he describes his early experience of learning to dance, and explains the Javanese way to watch dances such as the elaborate Bedhaya Gandakusuma, which is being rehearsed with a gamelan orchestra and singers. After samples from this one-and-a-half hour long dance, Pak Seno offers his interpretation of the significance of what we have just seen.

=505  00$aThis is the story of Thavro Phim, who came of age under the Pol Pot regime and lost his father, brother, and grandfather to the blood thirsty Khmer Rouge. What kept him whole after the ordeal was his Buddhist faith and his dedication to Cambodian classical dance where he performs the role of Hanuman, the magical white monkey. Now a Philadelphia-area resident, Thavro travels to the Kingdom of Cambodia, a country still in turmoil, We witness his bittersweet reunion with his remaining family and teachers. The film takes us back to the years 1975-79 when 90 percent of the dancers were executed or died of starvation or disease. Their story leads to Cambodia's Killing Fields, the refugee camps, and to Yale University's Cambodian Genocide Project which helps families access information about their loved ones. The film shows how Khmer children, whose parents survived Cambodia's darkest hour, are being taught in Cambodia and America to carry on their traditions for the sake of cultural survival.

=520  3\$aThis vibrant film focuses on the struggles and successes of two local women's groups fighting to preserve their land, forests and way of life in Brazil's Amazon region. The women combine scientific study, political advocacy and grassroots activism to save their communities' fields and forests from ranchers and loggers and to improve their standard of living. The farmers in Quinandeua invited Dr. Patricia Shanley, an American ethno-botanist from the Woods Hole Research Center, to educate the community about the use of non-timber forest products. As one villager says, "she showed us the value of the forest, that wood and fruit are both important." They have become aware that the forests must stay intact for fruits and herbs to be harvested for food and medicine. Through their participation in local politics and education, the women are gaining confidence and respect in what has been a traditionally male-dominated society for the past five hundred years. Throughout the region, women's associations are forming and becoming increasingly organized and politically engaged. In Nova Timboteua, ranchers seized the farmers' land illegally, and brutally in some cases. Women resisted and organized against them. Their efforts are part of a growing tide of popular unrest that is driving a profound political and social struggle to restructure the way resources are divided in Brazil. In the Amazon, the conflict with big business is most extreme. The women's groups are inspiring other Amazonians to take action to improve their lives.

=505  00$a"A cinematographic interpretation of the life of a group of Grand Valley Dani, who are mountain Papuans in West New Guinea (Irian Barat, Indonesia), studied by the Harvard-Peabody Expedition (1961-1963). This film was made by Gardner in 1961, before the area was pacified by the Dutch government. The film focuses on Weyak, the farmer and warrior, and on Pua, the young swineherd, following them through the events of Dani life: sweet potato horticulture, pig keeping, salt winning, battles, raids, and ceremonies." - Karl G.

=505  00$aBetween 1963-74, about 2000 Turkish and Greek Cypriots disappeared during hostilities between the two communities of Cyprus. Following an abortive coup in 1974, Turkey invaded and occupied the north of the island. 200,000 Greek Cypriots, a third of the population, fled their homes, becoming refugees in the south.During the Turkish invasion, many died in the war, but their bodies were never recovered. Others (including women and children) vanished behind the advancing Turkish army. To this day, Turkey refuses to offer any explanations. The fate and whereabouts of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots missing remains an official secret.

=505  00$aDeep Hearts is a film about the Bororo Fulani, a nomadic society located in the central portion of the Niger Republic of Africa. The title is a reference to an important aspect of these people's thought and demeanor.The Bororo are immensely beautiful. They are also extremely envious of each other's looks. This envy accounts for their truly suspicious nature; one which leads quickly to feelings of fear. They are particularly fearful of being 'devoured' by both the eyes and mouths of those around them with whom they compete as beautiful creatures.

=505  00$aThis film examines the indigenous rights revolution sweeping Mexico through the municipal elections in Huehuetla, Puebla. In 1989, the Huehuetla Totonacs formed the Organizacion Independiente Totonaca (OIT), and joined in an electoral alliance with the Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD). For ten years the OIT and the PRD carried out a non-violent revolution. The visible signs of this Totonac renaissance are the health clinics, schools, roads, drinking water and electricity available to everyone for the first time. But the real change is in the new self-confidence and pride of the Totonacs themselves.

=505  00$aThe celebrated Iranian photographer, Nasrollah Kasraian and his wife, anthropologist Ziba Arshi, have documented many unique populations living within the borders of Iran. This film provides a fascinating look at the Turkmans of Iran, who live in small villages northeast of Teheran, near the Afghanistan border. It examines how Turkman society has changed over several years. Devil on the Roof captures varied aspects of their traditional culture. It shows how shamans treat physical and mental illnesses with music, sticks and swords. It depicts the women's roles - raising children, working in the rice fields and weaving magnificent rugs and clothing. Four years after the initial filming, the filmmakers return to the Turkman villages where they find radical changes have occurred. The introduction of electricity has brought television - the key to modernization. Because of their geographical location, the Turkmans can pick up TV transmissions from the Russian Turks (Turkmanistan) and have access to Russian - and American-programs. The children watch sitcoms, play video games, drink Coke and attend schools decorated with paintings of Mickey and Minnie Mouse.

Here the Navajo people have lived on vast deposits of oil, coal and uranium. Their religion considers Mother Earth sacred and forbids them from exploiting her resources. But outside forces are at work, strip mining the coal and polluting the water. The sweet wells on Dineh land are drying up. This land has also suffered a uranium spill larger than that of Three Mile Island. Tens of thousands of Dineh were relocated. Others were fenced off from the land they worship. The film emphasizes the spiritual essence of the Dineh, with their unique art forms, music and original lifestyle.

They make their living picking through trash in search of recyclable material and are popularly known as donkeys without a tail. This occupation traces its roots to the job of garrafeiro, or "bottle collector." Portuguese immigrants to Brazil made their living pushing wooden carts down the street to collect bottles (thus their nickname bears the allusion to pack animals.) The early immigrants sold only bottles and other containers that could be re-used. Today trash collectors work with a wide variety of materials; plastics, glass, iron, copper, paper, and cardboard. By following the daily route of five of these energetic collectors we come into contact with one aspect of urban life in Brazil.

Despite its former prosperity and its rich resources, it was voted least developed nation by the UN in 1987, and human rights atrocities continue to prevail. Forced from their homes by the government, more than 100,000 people live in refugee camps along the border between Burma and Thailand; hundreds of thousands more hide in jungles on the Burma side. They are the Karen people, one of the largest ethnic groups in Burma.

Dreams of enormous catches have provided the incentive, but dreams are notably nebulous: for some, admittedly, their dreams have come true, but for others they have turned into nightmares.We meet fishermen on the Pacific island of Mitiaro, and with them fish for parrotfish on the offshore coral reefs. We take part in the world's largest fishery, that for anchovies off the coast of Peru. In China we learn how the world's premier fish-farming nation utilizes its age-old knowledge of. nature to feed millions of people. We also meet a group of affluent fishwives in Ghana and explore the bed of the Aral Sea in Kasakhstan together with local fishermen, men whose livelihood is slowly wasting away as the sea has dried out to less than half its natural size.

=505  00$aThe communal rituals of most villages of the Eastern Niger Delta focus on two great classes of spirits - the heroes and the water people. The heroes once lived with the men, founded their institutions and brought them their characteristic means of gaining a livelihood. Today, as spirits, they continue to maintain the established institutions and the skills with which people wrest a living from their environment. The water people, by contrast, have never lived with men: they are the creators and owners of the rivers and creeks, controlling the state of the waters and the abundance of fish. The little village of Soku, hidden in the heart of the eastern Delta, has a group of heroes headed by Fenibaso, and its creeks and rivers are controlled by the water-spirit Duminea. This film shows some highlights of the annual ritual for Duminea. As in most Kalabari festivals, spirit possession features prominently in the proceedings. The possession behaviour is controlled by public expectations, which lay down the stage of the proceedings at which each spirit will climb on his priest, as well as the patter of behaviour the latter will display once possessed. This type of possession, indeed, seems best considered, not as a primitive abnormality but as a public chore for which the community commandeers the bodies of perfectly normal citizens.

The ceremony celebrates the newborn's crossing a threshold from a neutral gender and status into a world of gender differentiation and family hierarchy.

=505  00$aSome animals have always fascinated mankind for their mystery and power. Elephants, crocodiles, snakes, apes, big cats and sharks are feared as enemies in some cultures and admired as super beings in others. Whether part of our nightmares or greatest hopes, this fascination has pushed man to want to confront these great animals and has given birth to surprising legends and beliefs that still haunt us today.Impressive rituals, ceremonies and combat scenes are gathered into six incredible stories that explain the bond between tribal animals and human kind and why they are so present in our imaginations.

The Eka Dasa Rudra, or Festival of the 11 Powers, was held by order of the high priests to restore the balance between good and evil in the universe. The entire Balinese population of two million participated. In Bali, religion governs all aspects of life. A complex synthesis of Buddhism, animism, Sivaism and Hinduism, its rituals go back to the dawn of time. The film captures the sight and sound of this richly textured event.

=505  00$aWhen Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia was overthrown in August, 1975, by Colonel Mengistu, sixty of his cabinet members were executed and he was never seen again. Yet there remained the belief among many Rastafarians that he was still alive. They continued to worship him as the Lion of Judah and considered him the Black Christ. The Emperor's Birthday, using old footage and interviews, sifts through the sequence of events that led to a Rastafarian movement in Ethiopia, England and the Caribbean. It shows that the movement was both political and spiritual. Curiously, the Emperor was mostly indifferent to them. In 1935, Mussolini invaded Ethiopia. Haile Selassie appealed unsuccessfully to the League of Nations for help. In reaction to this abandonment, there was an outpouring of support for him from people of African descent in the West. Marcus Garvey from Jamaica declared Africa for Africans and urged repatriation. Jazz in Harlem echoed with a longing for Africa. The film traces the preparations being made for the celebration of the Emperor's one hundredth birthday. We meet Rastas who had made arduous journeys from all over the world, and learn of the struggle with poverty faced by the ones who have settled in Ethiopia. This is probably as close a look as outsiders will get at a gentle, spiritual people who are closely identified with the African soul and whose ways have always aroused suspicion.

Farmers like the Hern‡ndez family, who lived by the river, went on working their fields and tending to their livestock. On the evening of May 20, 18-year-old Esequiel Hernández Jr. left the house to tend to his family's goats, taking with him, as usual, a .22 rifle to keep away wild dogs. It was the last evening of his life.

=505  00$aOur Wenatchi Reservation was taken from us in 1894. Our hunting and fishing rights were also taken at that time, against our wishes. Many of our tribesmen are scattered in various parts of the State of Washington where the land is poor...We, the Wenatchi Indians, wish to have our fishing and hunting rights restored to us in the Wenatchee Valley and forests." (Chief John Harmelt, 1933) This film makes an impassioned plea for the return of the land that was taken from the Wanatchi Indians of Washington State. For generations they lived and fished on their land. In 1855, they were offered a reservation under the terms of the Yakama Treaty. The U.S. failed to honor that treaty as well as others which were made with the tribe. Historian E. Richard Hart has been working in Indian affairs for over thirty years. He knows of no other case where a tribe was promised fishing rights in a ratified treaty and again in a ratified agreement, and still does not have those rights honored. As a result of these injustices, the Wenatchis had to leave their land. Most moved to the Colville Indian Reservation. In 1937, Chief Harmelt died, but today his granddaughter and her children have taken up the fight along with other tribal elders of the Wenatchi Advisory Board and many others. About 28% of the land in the area that should have been a Wenatchi Reservation is still a part of the public domain. When will the U.S. right this historical wrong?

At White Center Heights Elementary School, located just south of Seattle, Washington, the students speak twenty-seven different languages and come from fifty different countries. Eighty percent of the students speak no English at home and ninety percent qualify for free or reduced lunch. As schools grow more diverse across the country, White Center Heights appears more as a window into the future of education rather than an anomaly.

=505  00$aThis powerful and important film is the first to present an African viewpoint on a culturally explosive issue. Somali filmmaker Soraya Mire knows firsthand about the traditional African practice of female genital mutilation. At thirteen she was subjected to it and spent the next twenty years recovering physically and emotionally from its cruel legacy. Fire Eyes explores the socio-economic, psychological, and medical consequences of this ancient custom which affects more than 80 million women worldwide. In this film several women who have been subject to this "rite of passage" voice varying points of view on perpetuating the practice. While a few courageous women would spare their daughters this suffering, others fear their daughters would be unmarriageable. The troubling fact is that female circumcision is a women's ritual upheld by mothers, grandmothers and aunts, to conform to the male expectation for a chaste wife. Testimony from doctors detail the various forms of female circumcision and the horrendous ob/gyn problems that result. Dr. Groesbeck Parham, an African American, studied with a Sudanese doctor in Khartoum. He observes, "When you are confronted with a situation rooted in such deep cultural mores, you have to be careful not to become arrogant. But I think it is a practice that needs to be revamped." An extraordinary documentary for Women's Studies, Anthropology, African Studies, Public Health and Human Rights programs. (A closed captioned version available on vhs only.

=505  00$aThis is the classic film of cultural confrontation that is as compelling today as when it was first released over 20 years ago. When Columbus and Cortez ventured into the New World there was no camera to record the drama of this first encounter. But, in 1930, when the Leahy brothers penetrated the interior of New Guinea in search of gold, they carried a movie camera. Thus they captured on film their unexpected confrontation with thousands of Stone Age people who had no concept of human life beyond their valleys. This amazing footage forms the basis of First Contact.Yet there is more to this extraordinary film than the footage that was recovered. Fifty years later some of the participants are still alive and vividly recall their unique experience. The Papuans tell how they thought the white men were their ancestors, bleached by the sun and returned from the dead. They were amazed at the artifacts of 20th century life such as tin cans, phonographs and airplanes. When shown their younger, innocent selves in the found footage, they recall the darker side of their relationship with these mysterious beings with devastating weapons.Australian Dan Leahy describes his fear at being outnumbered by primitive looking people with whom he could not speak. He felt he had to dominate them for his own survival and to continue his quest for gold.First Contact is one of those rare films that holds an audience spellbound. Humor and pathos are combined in this classic story of colonialism, told by the people who were there.

=520  3\$aFor the first time since their land was taken many Native Americans tribes have the opportunity of taking over the rights to the land they live on and creating a cultural consciousness . No longer do they fit the old stereotypical image of the impoverished, drunken Indian. They now play a new role in American society both culturally and economically. The filmmakers start their journey in the Dakotas, where 100 years ago the Oglala Sioux Nation was nearly wiped out at Wounded Knee. Today the Oglala Lakota College is the fastest growing college in South Dakota. Navahos that live on the country's biggest Indian reservation, covering parts of Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, have chosen not to build casinos since their land is rich in coal, oil and minerals. Yet casino's remain the most refined revenge for past sins, enabling the East Coast tribes to systematically empty America's pockets. The filmmakers talk to an Indian attorney, a movie director, an artist, a nurse and others. The question remains will Native Americans be able to maintain their unique culture now that they are participating in the American dream.

=505  00$aLong ago, Earth was dominated by supernatural beings: spirits who lived in the forest and in the ocean. To live in harmony with them, Man had to learn to respect nature and animals. Today the Masters of the Spirits are the guardians of ancient beliefs uniting men and animals: by respecting these eternal legends, Man continues to live incredible adventures with animals, hoping to receive the spirit`s protection. For its 13 extraordinary and true stories, the series entitled "The Master of the Spirits" has sought out civilizations who still believe in magic, and whose people continue to share remarkable experiences with animals, hoping to win the favor of the spirits. From the mysterious fishermen of the Himalayan rivers to the last eagle tamers of the Kirgisthan mountains, this collection recounts the most beautiful legends featuring exceptional relationships between Man and animals.

=505  00$aFull summer, and the tundra is bare; skin tents are up and it is time to attend to the fishing as the fish move upstream. The men are in the river, lifting stones and placing them to form enclosures to trap the fish. A woman skins a duck and then braids her hair in the old way, stiffly around sticks. From a bladder she makes a balloon for the child. The men are fishing with the three-pronged leisters, spearing the fish and stringing them on a thong, until it is as much as a man can do to drag his catch from the water. The woman works quickly, cleaning the fish, and then all enjoy bits of the fresh raw fish.

Continuing a tradition passed down from father to son for generations, they form a Venezuelan community along the quays of downtown Willemstad, capital of Curaçao.

=505  00$aFlock of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus explores the Darwin vs. intelligent design controversy. Filmmaker/ evolutionary ecologist/ surfer Dr. Randy Olson travels to his home state of Kansas, the top battle ground for evolution, where he challenges top advocates for intelligent design, and with a sense of scientific inquiry tries to understand a movement that so misfired that in Dover PA., a Republican-Bush appointee judge labeled local efforts to teach intelligent design as "breathtaking inanity."School districts are now grappling with the efforts to introduce intelligent design, the movement evolutionists prefer to call "creationism in a cheap tuxedo." However Olson also paints an unflattering portrait of his fellow scientists. Pulling together eight evolutionists for a night of poker, he reveals them to be arrogant, condescending, and self-certain until they eventually turn on themselves in a spat that sounds like...a flock of dodos.The film provides laughter and enough serious ideas to prompt hours of discussion. Always trying to maintain a fair attitude, the film is one that audiences from both sides to watch it together.

=505  00$aBalafon is the name given in French-speaking West Africa to a xylophone with calabash resonators. This instrument is emblematic of the Senufo people of the Côte d'Ivoire (the former Ivory Coast). The balafon is played under differing circumstances and in combination with different groups of instruments. Not for nothing do the peoples of the Côte d'Ivoire call the northern part of their country "the land of the balafon."Filmed in long sequences to preserve the integrity of the music and speech of the musicians, this series of four documentaries introduces the audience to the fascinating world of a living musical tradition. Each documentary can be viewed independently, as a whole, or in sections indicated by chapter titles. The complete series lasts nearly 4 ½ hours (including extras), providing a full account of a sophisticated African musical tradition.

=505  00$aIn the south of Kenya every year, when everything is in blossom, the N'dorobos go through the bush in search of honey. Their strange ally in this search is the "euchoshoroi," a bird that has led them to the precious nectar since the beginning of time. For Kiloussou's people, honey plays a vital role. It provides food and the means to obtain cattle, but it is especially used to make a beer that is the focal point of all of the tribe's important rites.Kiloussou is an N'dorobo. He lives near the Masaï Mara animal reserve. Along with his father, M'Zegobe, and his young nephew Kisset, he leaves for the forest in search of honey. In the heart of the bush, Kiloussou and M'zegabe call upon their guide bird, which immediately responds and leads them.The bird's cooperation with the N'dorobo is not selfless. Once the honey has been removed, the bird can eat what it likes best without fear of being stung - the wax and the larvae, which the hunters let fall on the ground. And thanks to their faithful ally, Kiloussou and his people can soon return to the village to celebrate their abundant harvest.

Uncertain about their safety and fearing religious persecution in Khomeini's Islamic Theocracy, an estimated 80,000 of Iran's 100,000 Jews fled the country.

A Frontier Conversation documents a unique collaboration between Indigenous and white historians from Australia and North America. A Frontier Conversation documents a unique collaboration between Indigenous and white historians from Australia and North America. In September 2004, a diverse group travelled through the Top End of Australia meeting representatives of the traditional landowners, and engaging in a dialogue about Indigenous history. The themes that emerged raised more questions than answers - from cultural appropriation and copyright, to land rights, the role of language and art, and what history means to Indigenous communities in the current climate of cultural reclamation and survival.

=505  00$aMade for the United Nations, this documentary chronicles the logging damage that has taken place in the forests of Finnish Lapland over the past 50 years. Home to the indigenous Saami peoples, these Northern old growth forests are essential to Saami reindeer herding, a traditional way of life that the Saami hope to continue into future generations. Population growth in Finland has created economic pressure - prompting migration to the Saami lands in the North. The resulting forest cutting severely depletes the lichen necessary for free reindeer grazing, and logging infrastructure disrupts the entire forest ecosystem.

=505  00$aCaribbean children grow up playing games that shape the attitudes and expectations of their roles in later life. This video explores these games and looks at the adult games to which they lead, focusing on draughts in Barbados, dominoes in Dominica, all fours in Trinidad, warri in Antigua, and cricket on all the islands. It also questions the reasons for Caribbean women's historically low level of participation in these games.

=505  00$aAmong the Yoruba of Western Nigeria and Dahomey the Gelede cult honours the earth spirits, the ancestors and especially the Great Mother. The festival filmed here emphasises the status of women and placated their potentially dangerous mystic powers. The commentary emphasises that the annual Gelede festival serves a cathartic role by paying respect to women in a patriarchal society. During the course of the festival social tensions are brought out into the open and ridiculed; antagonism between the sexes is thus controlled and given a legitimate outlet. The film shows the preparation of masks and the climax of the festival in which the Great Mask appears at midnight. On the following day the lesser masks entertain, satirising the movements of women

=505  00$aThe films were made in the Anthropology Department of San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University at Northridge). Edmund Carpenter founded the department with the intention of moving anthropology beyond the book. He felt that the realities and insights of anthropology were often better represented in the arts than in scholarly texts and between 1957 and 1967 he led a flourishing and experimental department. In addition to cultural anthropologists, physical anthropologists and linguists, his faculty included folklorist Bess Lomax Hawes along with artists, musicians, animators and filmmakers.

=520  3\$aWhat is a griot? Historically, they are wandering African musicians considered to be a repository of the oral tradition. This film focuses on a master drummer, Adame Drama of Burkina Faso, a descendant of a long line of griots. He is a contemporary griot whose mission in life is to preserve his heritage and pass it on to the next generation. Resisting the lure of monetary rewards of an artistic career in Europe, Adame has elected to remain in his country and for forty years has pursued his music there. This colorful film is filled with music and dance as we see him perform on stage with other musicians and in celebrations on the streets and in courtyards. He reveals the secrets of his instrument and of his style of playing. Above all, he is a proud African who had rejected cultural colonialism in favor of maintaining his identity and that of his art.

The woman carries heather and moss to camp and the man makes a whirling bullroarer for the boy. Another child pretends to drive a dog sled. A woman is working sinews into bowstrings, while another is busy with a seal skin. A woman prepares to cook a meal and a man makes a bow from bone and sinews. It is a demanding task to combine such materials into a strong supple weapon; the result is pleasing to the man. The next day the men move out on the sea ice with a dog to look for seal pups.

Now the women are out gathering moss for the fires and we see the birds and flowers common to the area. A woman skins a seal pup while another sews skins for a tent.

One makes a strike with his harpoon and others come to watch. They are ready to eat and relish the good warm blood and the liver. Another hunter succeeds, and then another but this one loses his catch when his thong breaks and the seal slides back into the water. But the party has three seals in tow when they return to camp, and soon the women have the meat exposed and all eat. Then the blubber is packed into the sealskin bags and the men haul it away to the cache.

=520  3\$aMoved by a sense of outrage, David Scheffel, a Canadian anthropologist, is determined to help the impoverished Roma (Gypsies) rebuild their community in Svinia, a village in Eastern Slovakia. So-called "white" Svinia is a picturesque, typical Slovak village with well-kept homes, gardens, a store and a school. A little past the last "white" home is "black" Svinia, where life is characterized by decay and despair. The Roma dwell in squalid tenement blocks or in one-room huts without clean water or sewage facilities and little hope of employment. "White" Svinia despises the Roma who, in desperation, regularly burglarize their homes and gardens. Some "white" praise Hitler's policy of trying to exterminate the Roma. This powerful film gives an unprecedented look at a degraded ethnic group right in the middle of Europe, and the efforts being made to improve their lot.

=505  00$aHaitian Song is a lyrical portrait of life in a small village in rural Haiti. The film focuses on the "rituals" which compose the texture of everyday life: getting water from the river; making rope by hand from sisal; cooking rice and beans in an outdoor kitchen; planting and harvesting.Through intimate and detailed scenes, the film follows Gustav and Zilmen, a man and a woman, through the cycle of their day and follows the larger community through the cycles of the week: the market on Tuesday; the cockfight on Saturday; the dance on Sunday.

=505  00$aLong ago, Earth was dominated by supernatural beings: spirits who lived in the forest and in the ocean. To live in harmony with them, Man had to learn to respect nature and animals.Today the Masters of the Spirits are the guardians of ancient beliefs uniting men and animals: by respecting these eternal legends, Man continues to live incredible adventures with animals, hoping to receive the spirit`s protection.For its 13 extraordinary and true stories, the series entitled " The Master of the Spirits" has sought out civilizations who still believe in magic, and whose people continue to share remarkable experiences with animals, hoping to win the favor of the spirits.From the mysterious fishermen of the Himalayan rivers to the last eagle tamers of the Kirgisthan mountains, this collection recounts the most beautiful legends featuring exceptional relationships between Man and animals.

=505  00$aThis colorful film portrays three Sami women of different generations as they follow the reindeer herds of Lapland. Their stories reflect the transition from a nomadic existence to modern life. When a court case questions their ancient rights to the reindeers' pasture, their life as reindeer keepers is at risk. The film captures the vulnerability of indigenous peoples in the modern world and the colonization process which has led to the present conflict over the right to land and water.

Kenrap chose his life away from his family: when he was five, he remembered he was the reincarnation of a 68 year-old monk, and then decided to return to the monastery where he belonged. Filmed from the point of view of a subjective camera by a young ethnologist, Path to the Sky follows this attaching little monk with whom we share moments of intimacy, and gives us a rare glance at Buddhist monastic life.

In just three months, from August to October, the Zanskaris have to harvest and store all their food for the coming year. All the women-young and old alike-work nonstop, from dawn to dusk, and worry about the arrival of winter.Filmed from the point of view of a subjective camera by a young female ethnologist, Land of Women offers a sensitive and poetic immersion in the life of four generations of women during harvesting season. We share their rare intimacy and gradually grow attached to them.

=505  00$aHimalayan Herders is an intimate portrait of a temple-village in the Yolmo valley of Central Nepal where Tibetan Buddhists consult shamans, married life begins by kidnapping the bride, and the nearest road is a two-day walk away. The community drama of marriage, death, and rituals is juxtaposed with the rich texture of daily life, both in the village and the surrounding mountains and forest where these pastoralists herd zomo, a cross between a cow and a yak, which thrives in middle altitude pastures between 8,000 and 14,000 feet.

=505  00$aStoney says he has dumb luck. His grandfather was the doctor on the island in Ireland where the legendary maker of documentary film, Robert Flaherty, shot his film Man of Aran. So Stoney's film, exploring the effects Flaherty's film had on the island and its people, is digging into his own roots as an individual while simultaneously studying the work of his intellectual mentor as a producer of nonfiction films.Robert Flaherty's 1934 classic Man of Aran chronicled fishermen's struggle for existence on Ireland's bleak Aran Islands. Stoney revisits the islands and interviews surviving locals about their memories of the original film - and their reactions to making this one. It includes excerpts from the original documentary.Stoney says, "How the Myth Was Made illustrates what I believe to be a common truth: the filmmaker always leaves his mark on the places and the people he films."

To live in harmony with them, Man had to learn to respect nature and animals.Today the Masters of the Spirits are the guardians of ancient beliefs uniting men and animals: by respecting these eternal legends, Man continues to live incredible adventures with animals, hoping to receive the spirit`s protection.For its 13 extraordinary and true stories, the series entitled " The Master of the Spirits" has sought out civilizations who still believe in magic, and whose people continue to share remarkable experriences with animals, hoping to win the favor of the spirits.From the mysterious fishermen of the Himalayan rivers to the last eagle tamers of the Kirgisthan mountains, this collection recounts the most beautiful legends featuring exceptional relationships between Man and animals.

=520  3\$aTwo Peruvian musicians, Ebert and Jabier, have dedicated their lives to researching the ancient musical traditions of Peru. Ebert reproduces the old instruments, using natural materials such as bamboo, clay, bone and horn. He also collects the music for the Peruvian Institute for Culture and teaches it to children so it will survive. After being blessed by a medicine man in a sacred ritual, Ebert and Jabier journey into the rain forest where they visit three tribal communities. In the first village, where Machiguenga Indians live, only the old shaman still remembers the songs. In another village, Palotoa, very few recall their traditions. The missionaries' threats of "burning in hell" have made the Indians afraid to practice their original rituals. In the last village they visit, Diamante, the inhabitants have completely lost their identity due to the destructive influence of the timber company, the missionaries and tourism. Children are ashamed of being Indian and the women only dance when a tourist boat sails by. Saddened by this erosion of cultural roots, the two musicians will nevertheless preserve the music that a few of the elderly shared with them.

The setting is the spring Equinox when a shadow said to represent the Maya serpent-god Kukulkan appears on one temple pyramid.

Kowire and his wife Withawo get up early to take care of their eight children, preparing food and making handcrafts for sale.

This video provides a vehicle for engaging students in classroom discussions about what it means to be "different" and shows us the unique contributions that can be made by everyone when given the opportunity.

Rouch explains the sacrifices he made due to the producer that took on his film and the "monster" thus created; his footage was re-edited with a new ending, new titles, stock footage, "tropical muzak," and a newsreel-style narration heavy on drama and highlighting the exotic.

They build a karmak and move in the furs, cooking troughs, etc. The woman sets up her lamp, spreads the furs and attends to the children. There are signs of returning wildlife. The man moves out on the lake ice and chips a hole for fishing. He baits his hook and lowers it jigging the line to attract the fish. Crouched by the hole, he persists with his purpose and takes some fish, as does his wife who has joined him. Both remain at the hole through a severe blizzard.

=505  00$aThis film is the follow up of First Contact. It traces the fortunes of Joe Leahy, the mixed-race son of Australian explorer Michael Leahy, in his uneasy relationship with his tribal neighbors. Joe built his coffee plantation on land bought from the Ganiga in the mid 1970's. European educated, raised in the highlands of Papua, freed by his mixed race from the entanglements of tribal obligation, Joe leads a Western lifestyle governed by individualism and the pursuit of affluence.While Joe may live in Western grandeur, he is still surrounded by his subsistence level Ganiga "neighbors," who never let him forget the original source of his prosperity. Joe spends much of his waking hours just keeping the lid on things.Filmmakers Connolly and Anderson lived for eighteen continuous months on the edge of Joe's plantation, in the "no man's land" between Leahy and the Ganiga. Their lively, non-judgmental narrative eloquently captures the conflicting values of tribalism and capitalism.

This follow-up film concentrates on the Arhuaco Indians who continue to maintain their strong spiritual and cultural identity in the face of wide ranging attempts to grab their land, torment their spiritual leaders, and make their independent lifestyle untenable. The Arhuaco are unimpressed with the earlier film even though it attempts to plead their cause to the outside world. Physically small, garbed in pristine white with box-like headdresses, pain smolders on their faces when they speak of the injustice they have suffered, including the assassination of their spiritual leaders. The Journey Back gives voice to the ravages of their colonial history. Member of a series: The Earth is Our Mother (Part I)

The music of the balafon is a source of joy while the young men are doing collective work in the fields, at age-group ceremonies, for the poro initiatory society, for the catholic mass and during young people's dance evenings. Musicians and non-musicians, young and old, talk about the different occasions for which this instrument is an indispensable presence marking the rhythms of life for this agricultural people. Traditional balafon music is far from dying out, and its extraordinary vitality and importance are evident in the activities of the younger generations.

After a week of hard travel in desert-adapted vehicles, they met Toma Tsamkxao and his Ju/'hoan band in Nyae Nyae. In their own words, Toma's extended family describes how they survive by gathering bush foods and hunting game. Thus begins a relationship between the Ju/'hoansi and the Marshalls that will last over half a century.

=505  00$aKāle and Kāle portrays the subtle everyday interactions and relationships between an uncle and nephew, both nicknamed Kāle (pronounced kah-lay), and their families in rural Nepal.Rather than adopt a conventional ethnographic approach, which might depict these individuals as representatives of a particular caste - in this case as itinerant musicians known as the Gāine - this piece aims to move beyond the didacticism that often informs documentary film by providing glimpses into the local lifeworlds these individuals inhabit. The roles they play within their families, in village society, and in neighboring communities are slowly disclosed through a series of discrete vignettes. Through the careful pacing of the scenes and the length of individual shots, this video also explores the experience of time and its passing in rural Nepal. The work invites the viewer to engage unhurriedly and sensorially with its subjects and their environment.

The film documents their journey into the harsh and arid landscape of Namaqualand and the Great Karoo interweaving musical performance and interviews with violinists, guitarists, piano accordionists and mouth organ players who play what Kramer describes as Karoo Blues. Little is known of the origins of this music. It is the music of shepherds and sheep shearers who are descendants of the original inhabitants of these semi -desert areas. This music has probably evolved in much the same way as the Afrikaans language that the musicians speak a blend of indigenous and colonial influences. By the end of the journey nine musicians are invited to Cape Town where they record some of their songs and perform to packed houses and great acclaim. An endangered culture has been given a new breath of life. Longer version (92 min) is available

=520  3\$aOn July 28th, 1996, two college students stumbled upon an anthropological find that would change forever the way North Americans view their past. While sneaking into hydroplane races on the Columbia River in Kennewick, WA., Will Thomas and Dave Deacy noticed a human skull mired in the mud. It turned out to be one of the oldest and most complete skeletons ever found in North America. James Chatters, the anthropologist who eventually investigated the skeleton, determined that the skull had "Caucasoid" features. The word, "Caucasoid," and the subsequent carbon dating of the bones, which found them to be over 9,000 years old, ignited a firestorm of controversy. These events pitted science against religion and scientists against Native Americans. The scientists demanded the right to study the bones. The Umatilla Tribe believed the bones to be sacred and ancestral. They were adamant that the bones be repatriated to the tribes for reburial. The American government, seemingly caught in the middle due to the fact that the remains were found on Federal land, decided to repatriate the remains to the Tribe. Eight scientists then filed a lawsuit in order to block this repatriation, claiming that more study was needed to determine ownership. The documentary explores with humor and compassion the cultural assumptions and differing opinions among the various groups involved, and attempts to explain why so many have claimed the bones of Kennewick Man. The far-reaching implications for the future of American anthropology, our view of America's ancient past, and the present day relationship between Native and non-native people are addressed.

The question, "Education for what?" is posed when both tradition and modern forces common to developing areas make the economic outlook bleak for young people, even if they are able to complete local educational requirements.

=505  00$aDomestic violence against women is rife among the Samburu in Kenya. In Samburu culture the women also do all the work, including building the homes, herding, collecting firewood and water and caring for the children. In the 1980's and 90's two hundred women from the tribe claimed they were raped by men from a nearby British army base. The Samburu men rejected them, whipped them and threw them out of their homes. In 1990 a small group of these stigmatized women decided to band together and create their own village. Under the leadership of one woman, Rebecca Lollosoli, their village has prospered, taking advantage of the income from tourism. The Samburu men have tried to sabotage the tourist business and have also mounted raids on the village. Finally, the Samburu men's chief tried to effect a reconciliation, but the women vehemently rejected his proposal. They are clearly enjoying the advantages of independence!

=520  3\$aThis film shows the Afro-Cuban religion, Santeria, whose New World practitioners have too often been maligned out of ignorance and prejudice and even harassed by authorities. In this intimate documentary we see a contemporary Puerto Rican community of "santeros" gather for the initiation of a priest of Shango, the "Thundergod" of the traditional Yoruba religion. As we follow the initiate through a series of ritual events, a new perspective on ancient rites is revealed. The religion originated in Africa and the chants are sung in Yoruba. Rituals like these are the basis of ceremonies performed in churches and temples of established religions. Sacred stones washed in sacred, leafy waters become the energy for ritual purification and empowerment. The anointment of head, feet and stones with the blood of sacrifice ensures atonement. On the third day the community gathers to witness the divination session in which the initiate receives his new name, "Oba Ko Puro", translated from Yoruba as "The King Does Not Lie." With the name, comes the story of the initiate's transfer of allegiance from an outer/worldly to inner/spiritual authority. Combining ritual narration with poetic translation from Lucumi/Yoruba chants provides the viewer with an understanding of the literal and figurative dimensions of the ceremony. A film of special interest to students of comparative religion, ritual, and Afro-Caribbean culture.

In 1960 Collin Hanney, an explorer, discovered an isolated group of Mayan Indians who 400 years earlier had fled into the Mexican jungle to escape the Spanish invasion. His discovery thrust the Indians into the modern world. Now Hanney's widow returns to the group to see how they have fared and to show them the photos and films Hanney shot when he first encountered them. The film combines the widow's pilgrimage with the story of one of the sons of a Mayan wise man encountered by Hanney, who pays homage to his father. We learn how the tribe has struggled to keep their culture and language alive, and how they are combating the exploitation of their raw materials and the influx of outsiders. Besides these challenges there is also the effect of access to education and technology on the younger generation. The film provides insight into the history and mythology of the Lacandon, whose stories even foretold the impact of the destruction of the rain forest on the whole world. It eloquently captures the conflicting values of ancient civilizations and the modern world.

In footage spanning five continents - from rainforest longhouses in Borneo to dramatic mountaintops in the Canary Islands-dynamic visions of art, music and dance are woven into a vivid global mosaic.It makes the point that the way we think, speak, and express our ideas is a reflection of our language. The film reminds us of how quickly some languages are disappearing while introducing the native tongue as an all-important vehicle for maintaining culture, sharing traditional wisdom, and envisioning the future.

Although in the beginning, these suicide pilots were university graduates and intellectual elites in their 20s, by 1942 the Navy was aggressively recruiting a large number of boys who were only in their low teens. Fortunately, some never flew their final suicide mission because the war ended before it was their turn to fly out.

=505  00$aRelegated to remote reservations on the rugged slopes of Mt. Pinatuba, the Aetas, the original inhabitants of the Phillipines have battled lowland expansion, commercial logging, and increasing encroachment on their ancestral land. They are struggling to survive and to preserve their ancestral culture. The Last Refuge was conceptualized in collaboration with anthropologist Dr. Ruffino Tima. It traces the history of this endangered tribe. They were hunted down and killed as "uncivilized savages" by the Spanish colonizers who sought their eradication, and were exploited as slaves by their lowland Malay counterparts. Rare archival footage documents life on the reservation that the Americans created to provide a sanctuary for these "non-Christian" people. The Americans tapped their jungle skills as guerrilla fighters during World War II. The Last Refuge presents the only footage available of tribal life before Mt. Pinatubo's devastating volcanic eruption, and track's the Aetas as they cope with the obliteration of this mountain sanctuary, their last refuge.

=505  00$aThe Last Rites of the Honourable Mr. Rai is a film about the cremation of a longtime resident of the holy city of Varanasi. This film, made at the request of the Rai family, is possibly the most detailed and respectful study of the Hindu rites of cremation on the sacred banks of the river Ganga at the historic Harish Chandra Ghat. With no invasive narration but with inter-titles and subtitles the film enables the viewer to see, hear and experience all that is said by the mourners, the funerary priest and cremation ground specialists, as they carry out this final rite of passage for a Hindu.

Their existence is primitive and has changed little for 100s of years. Hermino is 27, a strong and vigorous figure at home with his sheep on the mountains. But the call to leave behind tradition and join the modern world is strong. The doc is intimate and poignant, with Hermino comfortable for the camera to search deep into his beautiful if uncertain world.

=505  00$aMade for the United Nations, this documentary chronicles the logging damage that has taken place in the forests of Finnish Lapland over the past 50 years. Home to the indigenous Saami peoples, these Northern old growth forests are essential to Saami reindeer herding, a traditional way of life that the Saami hope to continue into future generations. Population growth in Finland has created economic pressure - prompting migration to the Saami lands in the North. The resulting forest cutting severely depletes the lichen necessary for free reindeer grazing, and logging infrastructure disrupts the entire forest ecosystem.

=505  00$aThis film celebrates the long and rich tradition of Latin culture in this country in its vivid portrayal of Ybor City, Florida. This multicultural community was founded in the 1880's, when Cuban, Spanish and Italian immigrants arrived to work in the thriving cigar factories. It flourished until World War II when the effects of assimilation, urban renewal and the decline in the cigar industry led to its demise. The film captures the colors, rhythms, and texture of this close-knit, ethnic enclave. Here people played dominoes over a cup of cafe con leche, socialized at the dance clubs, and took pride in a perfect, hand-rolled cigar. Although they experienced hard times and discrimination, they always had a protective community to fall back on.

=505  00$aThis remarkable film, seen through the eyes of one family, documents five years in the life of a South African tribe, the Ndebele, exploring their extraordinary art, culture and traditions. Tribe member Francina Ndimande is an internationally recognised mural artist, as is her daughter Angelina. Their work is commissioned by art collectors all over the world. The film explores the rituals and traditions associated with the rites of passage of both men and women. Francina's son, Gerald, is featured as he embarks on his two-month initiation into adulthood, or "journey to the mountains of manhood", guided by his elder brother Erasmus. We also follow her granddaughter during her uguthombe, her two-year initiation into womanhood. The Long Tears also traces the history of the Ndebele defeat in war against the Boers over a hundred years ago, and their subsequent enslavement and mistreatment at the hands of the Boer farmers. It shows us the famous Ndebele wall art and dress traditions and puts them in the context of the new South Africa. Here is a portrait of a unique people, told in their own words.

=505  00$aAttenborough embarks on a personal quest to uncover the history of a strange wooden figurine carving which turned up in an auction room in New York during the 1980s.The auction catalogue indicated that the carving was from Easter Island and the auctioneers told him that the sculpture had come from a junk-shop dealer in Pennsylvania. He knew that the, "grotesque head, attached to a body grossly elongated and as thin as a stick," was more important than the auctioneers believed it to be and had such presence and power that he bought it. He began an investigation to trace the origins of the artifact-an investigation that spans the globe and leads him on voyages to Russia, Australia, England, the Pacific, a Tahiti beach and finally to one of the most remote places on earth; and 15 years later, in a personal detective story that combines art, anthropology, and history traces the origin of the carving and in doing so tells the story of a forgotten civilization and of a people who inhabited one of the most remote places on Earth.

=505  00$aThis beautifully filmed documentary was shot in Niger, in the barren landscape of the desert, where a nomadic tribe, the Tuareg, keep their traditional ways. A charismatic teenager, Rhaissa, is about to marry a man she has never met. She learns from her girlfriend Fatima that her husband-to-be is not very handsome nor has an abundance of "ashek" or pride. But Rhaissa only giggles for she is resigned to her fate. Her parents have accepted the proposal and the unspoken tribal rules must be followed. This is the last time that Rhaissa can be a girl and have a shepherd's freedom to follow the sheep.The marriage ritual demands that Rhaissa spend the week before her marriage in a wedding tent, where she cannot speak to anyone or leave its confines. It is hard for this beautiful, energetic girl to be so confined but she submits with good grace. Her friends rubs potions into her skin and brush her hair as they prepare her for the big event.Outside the tent the wedding celebration begins in earnest as villages arrive on camels loaded with gifts, Some of her other girlfriends are rebelling against these tribal ways and want to choose their own mates. Rhaissa however remains a dutiful Tuareg, and is willing to first meet her husband on the wedding night. This warm, intimate documentary allows the viewer to glimpse a tradition that may soon be just a memory.

=505  00$aThe Indian software outsourcing industry has emerged as a key node of the global economy. The series of ethnographic films, Coding Culture, explores the cultures of outsourced work and the moulding of a new workforce to cater to this global high-tech services industry. Each of the three films focuses on a single company, representing one of the major types of software company found in Bangalore: a medium-sized Indian-owned company software services company (Mphasis: The 'M' Way); the offshore software development centre of a U.S.-based IT company (Sun Microsystems: Fun@Sun); and a small 'cross-border' startup company that produces its own software products and markets them to global customers (July Systems: July Boys).

He returned to Kenya to film the lifestyles and colorful ceremonies of his people before their culture becomes extinct. We learn that the traditional pastoral and nomadic life is under attack by outside forces who want to impose a money economy and privatize of land. The traditional way of ruling by a council of elders is being supplanted by elected officials (and even in Maasai land there are complaints on the accuracy of the voting cards!) The community is divided among those who voice their intense displeasure at the erosion of traditions and those who feel that the Maasai must change if they are to survive in today's world. The Maasai speak frankly to the filmmaker since he is one of their own.

=505  00$aAt once sharp and poetic, this film explores issues such as globalisation, development, wealth and love in the Maasai culture. Leaving stereotypes behind, the documentary shows us a people greatly aware of the world we inhabit, and invites us to recognise the need to change our lifestyles in order to survive. It will confront us with our habitual conceptions and pre-justices about indigenous people and about the actual meaning of development.The Ngorongoro district, home to the Maasai people, is one of the world's most popular safari-locations. The Maasai have maintained their traditional way of life for centuries, and still they are fully aware of both global warming and the financial crisis. And they are very much influenced by both. The access to land is fundamental, but it is a daily struggle with the authorities to maintain the right to land that has been their home for centuries. This conflict is bit of a paradox, as the Maasai have always been living in harmony with the wildlife - the primary reason why wildlife is found to such abundance in Maasai areas. But the problem is the huge income from tourism, an income the authorities would like to keep to themselves.

We see a hospice where cows spend their last days in comfort. When the BBC reports on the mass slaughter of cows due to mad cow disease, the Indians are appalled. One suggests that the British send their sick and old cows to India for caretaking. When McDonalds opened up in New Delhi, featuring the Maharajah Burger, there was outrage at this affront. To many Indians it is a symbol of Western cultural imperialism - Western greed undermining traditional values in India. One elderly maharajah hopefully observes that the Indian culture has survived thousands of years and will not succumb to this latest onslaught.

=505  00$aWhile the media has focused on the violent history of South Africa, it has paid little attention to a social phenomenon of great importance. Some nine-million South African blacks live with a strong commitment to their religion, Pentecostal Christianity. Their faith has enabled them to survive appalling hardship and deprivation. Their religion is a blend of deep-rooted African traditions and the imported values of Christianity. This commitment could be a stabilizing force in the new South Africa. This film captures the joyous singing and rhythmic movement that is common to the various black churches. It shows the African influence on funerals, baptisms, and weddings. Through these ceremonies the churches foster a sense of community and pride at being black South African. Adherents cut across all social classes. One sees an educated civil rights lawyer practice centuries-old healing practices. We hear from representatives of the traditional Church hierarchy, such as Archbishop Tutu and Allan Boesak, who have a profound respect for the adaptation of Christianity to the African culture.

=505  00$aMarcellin Babey, from the Swiss Jura, is thirty-five years old. He works in an old workshop in the heart of Lausanne, concious that building speculators will oust him some day. As there are no longer any apprenticeships in wood turning in Switzerland, Babey learned his craft from the former owner of his Lausanne workshop, and by going, on foot, to visit old turners in France and Spain. When he learned from old documents that the inhabitants of the Swiss canton of Vaud used to play bagpipes on holidays before the Bernese Protestants forbade it in belief that it was an instrument of the devil, Babey decided to build the instrument as it used to be. In the film, we see him make and play the bagpipes.

=505  00$aThis documentary is a fascinating portrait of one of the most influential women of our time. Using never-before-seen archival footage, stills, interviews and dramatic re-creations, it weaves together a story of a scientist, adventurer and international celebrity whose ideas shaped how we think about ourselves. The film tells how she first gained attention in the 1920's and '30's with her pioneering studies of youth and gender in Samoa and New Guinea. By age 33, the five-foot, one-hundred-pound Mead had traveled three times around the globe, explored unchartered lands where few men and no women dared to go. By age 34 she had published three bestsellers, taken the second of three husbands, and revolutionized our understanding of what it means to be male or female. When she was not doing fieldwork, most of her professional years were spent at the American Museum of Natural History. In her later years she was often seen on television as a bespectacled, sometimes outrageous advice-giver to the Vietnam War generation. This film deals with the controversies as well as the accomplishments of her life. Here is a valuable film for Women's Studies, Anthropology and History, as well as public library audiences. This film was partially funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Science Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation.

=505  00$aThe legendary Peruvian town of Paradise was once a tropical utopia. After an earthquake in the 1970's buried the city of Yungay, killing 70,000, the survivors were given government aid to settle a new town in the jungle which they called Paradise. Here they dreamed of creating a better future for their families. In the beginning, the peasants grew corn, coffee and other crops. When the economic aid ended, the residents turned to coca cultivation. The valley became the source of 60% of the world's coca leaves. Then the town was taken over by drug lords and the people's dreams soured. Drugs were flown out of the valley's seven airports as local authorities turned a blind eye in exchange for bribes. Suddenly the Shining Path Maoists burst into the town of Paradise. At first, they protected the dealers in exchange for a share of the profits. But soon they launched an audacious bid to take over the market and started terrorizing the residents. Hundreds were killed in a legendary battle which prompted the government to launch a full-scale assault on the Maoists. Paradise was destroyed, but the original settlers are starting to come back to rebuild. Memories of Paradise gives a fresh perspective on the complexities of terrorism and the "drug wars."

Today the Masters of the Spirits are the guardians of ancient beliefs uniting men and animals: by respecting these eternal legends, Man continues to live incredible adventures with animals, hoping to receive the spirit`s protection. For its 13 extraordinary and true stories, the series entitled " The Master of the Spirits" has sought out civilizations who still believe in magic, and whose people continue to share remarkable experiences with animals, hoping to win the favor of the spirits. From the mysterious fishermen of the Himalayan rivers to the last eagle tamers of the Kirgisthan mountains, this collection recounts the most beautiful legends featuring exceptional relationships between Man and animals.

It began with Cantometrics which developed a common language description for the many variables in performance style in the diverse cultures of the world and measured how those variables clustered geographically and in relation to means of subsistence and aspects of social organization.

=505  00$aAlaska has undergone a rapid transformation from traditional Eskimo life to modern living in an extraordinarily short period of time. The Nunamiut Eskimo village of Anaktuvuk Pass, is at once a microcosm of this larger transition and markedly unique. The three hundred residents of this small, isolated town are the only tribe of inland Eskimos in the world, comprising their own linguistic group and biological heritage. Unlike most traditional cultures which have been ravaged by Western culture, Anaktuvuk has balanced old ways and new horizons. The anthropologist lived among a family of four generations and captures with spontaneity their daily life. From the elders who remember hunting caribou and still speak only their native language to the youngsters who search the internet and participate in consumer culture, Anaktuvuk is two worlds in one. The film follows the day-to-day struggles of Juke and Julia, his pregnant girlfriend, as they try to come to terms with their future.

To his wife's dismay, he is obsessed with creating and running a fully functioning film theater from recycled objects. The seats, projector and the very films themselves come from discarded objects. He has turned his modest garage into a gathering place for the children of the village who experience the joy of cinema (and popcorn) free of charge. This short film shows how one man's obsession with cinema has taken over his life, while at the same time it bring pleasure to a whole community.

This documentary captures the color, romance and spiritual atmosphere that once led visitors such as Edith Wharton, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill to marvel at its magic. More than a tourist spectacle, the square with its storytellers, musicians, acrobats and snake charmers, embodies centuries-old cultural traditions. Our Moroccan guide informs us of the square's history as a destination for caravans from the Sahara and how from earliest times it has been a center for the dissemination of ideas. He weaves his way through the square which is overflowing with performers including the snake charmer, Blaid Farrouss and his young son who hopes to carry on his family's profession. We watch visitors enjoy their exchanges with people who at first appeared strange and exotic. In turn Moroccans show their interest in foreigners and the world beyond Morocco they represent. Always, our guide points to the importance of tradition and hospitality in the Arab world.

=505  00$aMountains of Gold is a unique chronicle of a nomadic, hunter / gatherer society undergoing the profound change to a money economy over a ten-year period. This tribe was first discovered by Australian explorers in 1938. Original footage shows their amazement at seeing their "white ancestors" in their midst. Until 1984 when gold was discovered on their land, the Ipili's wealth was still being measured by how many wives and pigs they had. When they decided to sell their land to the goldmining company, their way of life would change forever. The mining company began the long and arduous process of bargaining with the Ipili who were surprisingly skilled as negotiators. In the end the Ipili became among the wealthiest people in Papua New Guinea. Many spent their new found money quickly - on cars, alcohol and women. Living in suburban style houses changed the tradition of the men living together, apart from their families. The population burgeoned and shopping and church activities replaced time spent obtaining food. A social worker was needed to help them adjust.

=505  00$aIn Texan communities along the Rio Grande River, there is a vibrant mixture of Spanish Catholicism and Indian mysticism. For hundreds of years various saints and religious figures have made appearances to a receptive public. This film takes a respectful look at the current manifestations of these symbols of faith and the people who hold them dear. The filmmakers, one of whom is of Mexican descent, set out for the border to witness these phenomena themselves. They visit the modest home of Paulita Rivera in Hidalgo, TX, who discovered the face of Jesus in a tortilla she had made. Soon the tortilla was encased in plastic and revered by supplicants for its healing properties. Another town boasts the Shrine of the Holy Camaro where a religious silhouette suddenly appeared on a Chevrolet. Believers congregate daily to pray for miracles for their loved ones. In Brownsville stands the Madonna Tree whose bark displays an image of the Virgin. We hear from people who believe that God intervened for them and cured their ailments. In these border towns there is an abiding faith in spiritual forces. Just as their Indian ancestors saw divinity in the rising of the sun each day, so they have sighted objects of faith in their daily surroundings.

=505  00$aAlain Desjacques, a well-known ethnomusicologist, takes us on a pilgrimmage to find and record the best traditional musicians and singers on the steppes of Mongolia. Desjacques had spent time in Mongolia before and had learned the language. Thus he was welcomed and given access to domestic life, with its closely knit families and intergenerational living. Set against stunning vistas of the rugged terrain, the film captures not only the music, but the richly textured details of daily life - hospitality customs, food preparation, games, caring for the herds. It is a portrait of a people who live almost entirely off their animals - horses, yaks, camels, and sheep - with little contact with the outside world.Travelling by horseback, truck and foot, Desjacques tracks down the most revered diphonic musicians. The diphonic sound combines a base drone with a melodic upper register. We hear part of an epic song which takes the singer seven days to perform, completely from memory. The venerable flutist, Narantsogt, performs inside his yurt, producing diphonic sounds that mimic nature. His daughter serves the customary salted tea and yak yogourt fermented in a goat skin bag. The Musical Steppes of Mongolia provides a unique view of a rapidly disappearing culture.

=505  00$aLike Kurosawa's Woman in the Dunes, 67-year-old Kobra battles the elements on a lagoon in Iran to eke out a living for herself and her 100-year-old invalid mother. Even on New Year's day she is out in her rowboat before dawn, dropping and hauling her nets for the modest catch. She must argue fiercely with the men in the marketplace for a fair price, and physically battle fishermen on the water who claim the territory where her nets are placed. In an unforgettable scene the men tear her nets and scuffle with her on the deck until she falls into the water. Mother and daughter live together in a weather-beaten cottage on the edge of the lagoon. Pictures of their deceased loved ones surround them. The Koran, the voice of the mullahs on the radio, and their love for one another sustain them. With simplicity and honesty, this documentary makes a universal statement of the harsh realities many women face, and the strength that sustains them.

=505  00$aThe famous Navajo Code Talkers, memorialized by Hollywood in the feature film "Windtalkers," were an integral part of the armed forces during World War II. Navajo veterans who fought in the Pacific in World War II, used their unwritten Native American tongue as an unbreakable code language, essential in the American military intelligence machine. Richard West, President, Museum of the American Indian, says, "Ironically, the U.S. military used the Native American language as a potent instrument of war although the government had prohibited [native] people from speaking their own language for almost a century." Successive generations of young Navajo men who fought in the elite division of the U.S. Marine Corps, relate their stories in this film. Vincent and his brother enlisted in the 1970's; his brother died in Vietnam. Benjamin, Calbert and Michael are currently training as Marines in San Diego. The film reveals how their strong Navajo cultural identity and spiritual references correlated with traditional Marine Corps values and a passionate patriotism.

Their arid land is pierced with blocks of color, each dwelling singular in a stylized way. Their resplendent clothing also boldly proclaims their identity. This unique film also explores Ndebele rituals never shown on film before. We see their fertility rites, a celebration that bonds them to their ancestral tradition. Ndebele performance art shows how traditional forms of expression can become a vehicle for political empowerment today. Nelson Mandela referred to the Ndebele as a "Rainbow People." Despite a history of racial oppression, forced removal from their ancestral land and economic privation, their pride and sense of joy has endured.

Aduni Susanne Wenger, a chief priestess of the Obatala cult, is shown rebuilding the once neglected Oshun shrine, with her fellow artists, Adebisi Akanji, OyeWale and Lani. The Beiers show how art based on traditional pagan religion forms the foundation of the modern movement. How painters and sculptors have responded to exposure to modern techniques intelligently and sensitively introduced by Georgina Beier. Oshogbo's vibrant artistic life owes much to the founding of the Mbari Mbayo club by Duro Ladipo, also enthusiastically supported by Twins Seven Seven and Ogunmola. Many of Nigeria's world-renowned artists, play-writes and musicians have passed through Mbari Mbayo's doors. The club also distinguished its self by organizing the exhibition of art from other African regions - something that Ulli Beier was particularly keen to promote. This film presents a unique view of the vibrant, creative life typical of many Yoruba centres during this period. "Yoruba tradition is a living Force"

Due to the death of his adoptive father, he has to take part in mortuary ceremonies, whose form and content are passionately contested by different groups of relatives.Through prolonged negotiations, Ton learns how Baluan people perform and transform their traditions and not least what role he plays himself. The film is part of long-term field research, in which filmmaking has become integrated in the ongoing dialogue and exchange between the islanders and the anthropologist.

Home to the indigenous Saami peoples, these Northern old growth forests are essential to Saami reindeer herding, a traditional way of life that the Saami hope to continue into future generations. Population growth in Finland has created economic pressure - prompting migration to the Saami lands in the North. The resulting forest cutting severely depletes the lichen necessary for free reindeer grazing, and logging infrastructure disrupts the entire forest ecosystem.

=520  3\$aKili Radio, the "Voice of the Lakota Nation," is broadcast out of a small wooden house in the vast countryside of South Dakota. There, people converge to speak to the community about daily concerns and in doing so, strengthen their sense of identity. Daily existence on America's poorest reservation is hard. We meet people like Roxanne Two Bulls, who's trying to start over again on the land of her ancestors after a difficult life nearly destroyed by alcoholism; and Bruce, the white lawyer who for thirty years has been trying to free an American Indian militant who's been fighting for equal rights for his people. Everything comes together at Kili Radio. Instead of sending smoke signals the radio station transmits its own signals across a vast and magnificent landscape with a delightful combination of humor and melancholy. We hear native hip hop and complaints about broken windshields. Some of their pride has been restored with the radio broadcast; the listeners now feel that it really is acceptable to be Lakota. After all, "Kili" means awesome in Lakota. As the young DJ Derrick Janis who is discovering his gift for music says: "We once were warriors, I like to think about that. Back in those days I'd be a warrior on a horse. But today, I'm a DJ on a hill." A film about the role of media, as well as an up-close look at present day life on the reservation.

=505  00$aIn the desert of Namibia, life has always been a harsh struggle enriched by a feeling of oneness with the land. The people of Ova Himba were cattle herders, who followed the rains and knew where to find water and vegetation. They migrated between their encampments, the women repairing the huts with cow dung. Chief Kamasuthu, his mother, children and three wives always lived in the manner prescribed by their ancestors. They ground ocre with butterfat and herbs and decorated their bodies with this deep-hued mixture. This honored the fine cattle of their ancient gods. The drought and the war in Angola forced them into shanty towns and took away their dignity. Their children grew scornful of the old ways. This ancient, nomadic tribe, which had been untouched by the 20th century, now faces an uncertain future.

=505  00$aThis is the affirming story of how Candomble, a Brazilian religion of African origin, has become a source of strength and power for a group of AIDS sufferers. Shot in Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Bahia, it shows the rituals of Candomble and the celebration of Carnival. It features the personal struggles and words of wisdom from those whose faith have brought endurance and pride. Rather than denying the sexuality of this African-descendant population, innovative education programs have been developed for its followers. Where other religions preach abstinence, Candomble advocates the use of condoms so that sexuality need not be repressed. This beautifully shot documentary puts the epidemic in a cultural context, showing how this joyful religion helps its followers cope with the illness. An important film for classes in medical anthropology, folklore and religion, and Latin American culture.

=505  00$aThis film takes its title from a book written by filmmaker Edmund Carpenter in 1972 about his engagement with media in Papua, New Guinea. In the film, several filmmakers discuss the introduction of media, and film in particular, to native cultures.Media has the ability to help native peoples document their own cultures, but it also has the power to encroach upon those cultures and irreversibly alter them.This film relates the ways in which native peoples engage with media, from the Biami who proudly developed the "Big Wink" to learn how to properly focus a camera, to the Kandagan people who changed the rules of a thousand year old male initiation ceremony to allow a woman camera operator to document the ceremony. At issue is the way in which media "swallows cultures" and the benefits and dangers of introducing preliterate societies to Western modes of communication and expression.

=505  00$aAlthough it is acknowledged that the Gypsies were the victims of the Nazi scourge, this downtrodden group has seldom told its story to the outside world. When seventy year old Romany, Helena Malikova revisits Auschwitz where more gypsies met their end than anywhere else, she shares with us her bitter memories. The terrorist measures against the Romanies went back to a decree issued by the Reich President February, 1933, to the effect that the Romanies were among the "worthless" or "Gaunerpopulation." By December, 1938, Himmler had ordered the extermination of the Gypsy nuisance. Nazi doctors appraised each person for racial composition and determined who would go to an extermination center and who was to be crowded into a cold, barren work camp to suffer starvation and disease. The film also bears witness to the incredible disrespect the Communist regime had for the Romanies: a pig farm and a recreation center were built on the sites of the former concentration camps. The Gypsies put their suffering into mournful songs which survive today. The film is laced with their music and their memories.

=505  00$aTierra del Fuego, "land of fire," was first discovered by Europeans early in the sixteenth century. A group of islands that had separated from the southern tip of the South American mainland long ago, Tierra del Fuego had probably been inhabited by different groups of Indians for at least 9000 years. The largest island in the zone, the "Great Island," now divided between Chile and Argentina, was the homeland of the Selk'nam Indians, sometimes known as the Ona. Until their extermination began in the last two decades of the nineteenth century, there were between 3500 and 4000 Ona on the island. In 1919, Father Martin Gusinde counted fewer then 300, and by 1930 less than 100 Ona remained. By 1977, when this film was released, Angela, the last full-blooded Ona Indian, had died.

=505  00$aLong ago, Earth was dominated by supernatural beings: spirits who lived in the forest and in the ocean. To live in harmony with them, Man had to learn to respect nature and animals. Today the Masters of the Spirits are the guardians of ancient beliefs uniting men and animals: by respecting these eternal legends, Man continues to live incredible adventures with animals, hoping to receive the spirit`s protection. For its 13 extraordinary and true stories, the series entitled " The Master of the Spirits" has sought out civilizations who still believe in magic, and whose people continue to share remarkable experiences with animals, hoping to win the favor of the spirits. From the mysterious fishermen of the Himalayan rivers to the last eagle tamers of the Kirgisthan mountains, this collection recounts the most beautiful legends featuring exceptional relationships between Man and animals.

=505  00$aEach year, groups of Tibetan children secretly flee their homeland over the Himalayas to reach schools in India founded by the government in exile. Entrusted to smugglers, they are risking their lives by illegally crossing the great Himalayan range, a towering rampart between Tibet and India.The director will take us in the Mussorie school, in North India, where two thousand four hundred children have been rescued. They have left behind their family childhood and are now considered as orphans. We will discover the itineraries of Sonam, aged nine, and Dholma, the little new girl of the school. Here in India, they are taught about Tibetan culture and will find out about the history of their country and their ancestors. Sonam and Dholma's story is that of thousands of Tibetan children. Are they orphans of a lost country or bearers of hope who will save an endangered culture?

=505  00$aOur Lady's is the story of how one Boston suburban parish, energized by a dynamic leader, rose up against the powerful Church hierarchy to demand that their voices be heard. They became a part of what's been called the first full-scale laity revolt in the history of the Catholic Church. Father Walter Cuenin and his parishioners at Our Lady Help of Christians Church in Newton, MA were horrified and saddened when they learned that a popular priest had molested a number of local children years before. When it was revealed that the local church hierarchy, including Boston's Archbishop Cardinal Law, had known about the abuse for years but continued to transfer the suspected priest from parish to parish, their grief turned to collective outrage. Father Cuenin, a progressive and outspoken priest had clashed with Cardinal Law over issues like women?s ordination and gay rights in the past. Now he began to speak out publicly about problems in the Catholic Church, encouraging both his fellow priests and his parishioners to do the same. Voice of the Faithful was born, an organization demanding that lay people have a greater say in the running of the church. But in a culture where obedience is prized above all else, will a rebellious parish like Our Lady's be quashed?

Two keepers of tradition, the griot and the town's oldest woman and female griot, Ezenwanyi (Leader of Women), narrate this film continuing their role as commentators in the life of the village. Owu explores the pluralistic lives of Africans as they come up against westernized Christian influence. Many significant rituals are filmed for the first time. The program shows respect for the subject's traditions.

=505  00$aThis is one of the first explorations of the Samoan fa'afafines, boys who are raised as girls, fulfilling a traditional role in Samoan culture. The film shows how in the large Samoan family there may be one or two fa'afafines who are not only accepted but appreciated. They cheerfully share the women's traditional work of cooking, cleaning and caring for children and the elderly. Today's fa'afafines are becoming more westernized and look more like drag queens. Dance has always been an important part of Samoan culture. From an early age, the fa'afafines dance the female role, and many continue to dance as entertainers in nightclubs. We meet Cindy, a popular dancer, who has fallen in love with a representative of the Australian High Commission. They live together in the Australian compound, which lands him in trouble. He is transferred to Australia, but gives up his job and returns to be with Cindy. Several anthropologists, including Derek Freeman and Tom Pollard comment on the phenomenon. Paradise Bent brings up issues of culture and gender and the complexities of sexual identity.

=520  3\$aAs a child, Father Alberto de Agostini dreamed of Tierra del Fuego, inspired by his brother Juan, publisher of the book Tierra del Fuego, and Don Bosco, founder of the Salesian order. After becoming a Salesian himself, Father de Agostini studied geography. In 1910 he finally fulfilled his dream, settling in Punta Arenas, where he lived until 1958. During these years he assiduously explored the region, discovering the unknown zones, such as the Ice Fields; baptizing creeks and hills; establishing maps and simultaneously filming these places. In 1945 he published The Andes of Patagonia. De Agostini filmed and photographed the last survivors of several ethnic groups. Available for the first time in the US, de Agostini's 1928 film Patagonia documents the daily lives of the three native groups who inhabited Tierra del Fuego between Chile and southern Argentina: the Onas, the Alacalufes, and the Tehuelches. Featuring life amidst a rough terrain of rocky ice-capped mountains, majestic glaciers, and thunderous rapids, the film presents an early record of their hunting methods, healing rituals, clothes and basket making and way of life. Alberto also shows the colonization of Tierra del Fuego, from a rocky frigid terrain into an area with newly paved roads and agricultural productivity.

The Phans of Jersey City fills a gap in our cinematic history of Vietnam by documenting a South Vietnamese family recently relocated to the United States. Evoking the realist style and domestic drama of An American Family, the filmmakers lived with the Phans in order to achieve a remarkably intimate and detailed portrait of a family in transition as well as a country in transition.

Craftsmen and farmers, the ancestors of today's residents came to the Romanian highlands around the year 1822 with their families. Director Jana Sevikova succeeds in capturing the way of life in Rovensko, a remote village where time is measured by the changing seasons and their respective religious ceremonies and rituals.

All the material for a new chalet had to be carried up by man or mule, so the peasants who built and cared for these chalets used the nearest rocks available and found a way to extract the sand needed for cement right on the spot. They used to burn clods of earth for three days until all vegetable residue was burned away and only the minerals remained as pink sand.

=505  00$aThe films were made in the Anthropology Department of San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University at Northridge). Edmund Carpenter founded the department with the intention of moving anthropology beyond the book. He felt that the realities and insights of anthropology were often better represented in the arts than in scholarly texts and between 1957 and 1967 he led a flourishing and experimental department. In addition to cultural anthropologists, physical anthropologists and linguists, his faculty included folklorist Bess Lomax Hawes along with artists, musicians, animators and filmmakers.

=520  3\$aLost in the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean, the Polynesian islands are like an oasis in a maritime desert. Hawaii, the Easter Islands, New Zealand, French Polynesia... All of these islands are inhabited by one and the same people: the Polynesians. Men landed on these volcanic shores lined with coconut trees at the dawn of time. Where did they come from? From South America, from Asia? Did they just "drift" to these islands by chance or accident or did they populate these islands with purpose and intent? The answer to this mystery has been holding travellers in thrall.Throughout the 20th century, many explorers and scientists from all over the world set out to unravel the enigma: Eric de Bisschop, Thor Heyerdahl, Francis Cowan, David Lewis, James Siers... They discovered the forgotten history of an ancient boat, the double pirogue, and how to navigate without compass - to be guided only by the stars, the currents and the birds, just like the ancient seafarers.Their adventures confirm more recent scientific discoveries. 1500 years before Magellan first sailed around the world, the Polynesians had already colonised methodically the smallest specks of land in this vast Ocean...

=505  00$aTwenty-seven year old Altine is a mother of two, living on the plains of Northern Senegal. As we watch her going about her daily chores, rhythmically threshing the millet, cooking over an open fire, she tells us of her aspirations. Her strongest wish is for adequate food, good health, and to remain close to her family. Images of Western life have not penetrated her village which is three hours from a paved road. This cinematically beautiful film captures life in the dry season which lasts nine months. Cows and goats share the dusty landscape. Villagers trek great distances to bring back the heavy load of water for daily needs. Although life is difficult, there is a dignity about the people.

=505  00$aQudad is an ancient lime waterproofing plaster that has been used for several millennia in the Arabian Peninsula. In Yemen, where it most likely originated, it is found on religious and secular buildings and archaeological sites. Because of its elaborate and labor-intensive application (it takes a full year to set properly), this strong, resistant material has barely been in use for the past 30 years. As a consequence, very few masons know how to make and apply it.

=505  00$aWatching the lithe, expressive movements of Javanese masked dancer Rasinah, one would never believe a 72-year old woman is behind the mask! She is a master of an ancient form of mask dance called Topeng Cirebon, which originated in West Java, Indonesia. Rooted in Islamic mysticism, the spiritual significance of the masks and dances was restricted to "specialist families," who for centuries passed on their unique heritage from generation to generation. By the late 1900's the popularity of Topeng Cirebon had faded -- its mystical masters forgotten.Once one of the most popular of the Topeng artists, Rasinah had been reduced to poverty as the taste for this traditional art form waned. Two young men became enraptured by tales of a hidden national treasure living in a remote village. They set out to find Rasinah to rescue her dance from extinction. Not having danced in twenty years and afraid that she was now too old, she hesitates. But once she holds the mask, her body moves again like a young dancer and she is off on an incredible journey of renewal.The film captures ancient rituals, spirit-infested graveyards, and enchanted masks. Fortunately, Rasinah's granddaughter, Erli, is able to carry on the age-old tradition. This colorful documentary shows the history, function and meaning of these masked dances.

The oldest Dukha, is a divine seer, a 96-year old shaman, called Tsuyan. She is the link between the healing songs of the forest ancestors, her people and their reindeer.To live in harmony with them, people had to learn to respect nature and animals and to pass down their beliefs, from generation to generation, by invoking the song-lines of their deceased ancestors.

Poor families may wait years before accumulating enough resources to cremate their dead, who are buried in the meantime. In 1978 many more cremations than usual were carried out because of the great purification cermony, Eka Dasa Rudra, held at Bali's main temple, Besakih, in 1979. Religious officials recommended that all Balinese cleanse the island by cremating their dead, as part of the preparations for the great Besakih ceremony.

It confronts the question of why monkeys play by examining what they do when they play, and illustrates that the fundamental objective of play fighting is to bite without being bitten, a goal attained in part by climbing on top or getting behind the play partner.

We also meet karaoke-singing fishermen on Vietnam's mighty Mekong river, and learn how cod from the Lofoten Islands, in the north of Norway, find their way to restaurant tables in far-off Italy. And in the United States, on the banks of the Columbia and Snake rivers, we fish for salmon together with Indians who are fighting to retain their ancient fishing rights.

Recognizing citizenship among a nation is a basic human right, however the people of the mountain region - referred to as "Hill Tribes" - are facing a crisis that has led to the growth of trafficking of woman and children. In A Right to Belong, various Hill Tribe individuals discuss their personal experiences in attempts to gain citizenship, as well as explain how their communities as a whole have suffered.

=520  3\$aRiver People documents a timely issue - the clash between an ancient culture and modern society. It is the story of David Sohappy, a Native-American spiritual leader who was sentenced to a five-year prison term for selling 317 salmon out of season. For twenty years Sohappy has fished in open defiance of all state and federal fishing laws. He claims he has an ancestral right to fish along Oregon's Columbia River. As a result, he has become a symbol of resistance for indigenous people of the Northwest United States and beyond.River People uses Sohappy's case to explore the historic conflict over the resources of the Columbia and the political controversy involving fishing rights and the right to religious freedom. Behind the controversy is the story of a man caught in a conflict between two cultures, and two seemingly irreconcilable ways of looking at the world.

Continually in danger of evacuation and making a living primarily by begging for money, the Roma still manage to foster a strong community and lively social atmosphere.

The documentary Rouch's Gang follows the film crew and provides a glimpse behind the scenes as Jean Rouch and his four friends from Niger make their film. By providing an outsider's view of Madame l'Eau, the documentary provides insight into how Rouch approaches his films.

=505  00$aRitual fishing in a pond in Eastern Mali by the Dogon people.The Dogon arrived in Eastern Mali in the 14th century.Once a year they organise a ritual fishing trip to the Entogo sacred pond to bring good luck to all the participants.The date for fishing is carefully chosen by the elders and Amadoun is the designated messenger to go around and announce the date, with his 13-year-old son Idrissa who is proud to be travelling with his father for the first time.For the Dogon, speech and weaving are closely linked.The word is in the sound of the pulley and the shuttle, filling the empty spaces between the threads.They say here that the stomach is a forge which manufactures speech.Heated by the fire, the water is turned into sound vapor, which becomes loaded with meaning and surges to the throat.At Entogo, the fishing lasts only a quarter of an hour, and each man must trap some of these precious fish, an assurance of peace and happiness in the year to come.

=505  00$aIn the north of Chad, in the heart of the Sahara desert, lies a forgotten mountain massif, which shelters, in its secret canyons, a flora and fauna of breathtaking beauty.In 1950, Hubert Gillet, a professor at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, began to explore this lost paradise. For more than a decade, he travelled through these mysterious mountains, on the back of a camel, discovering « a unique flora and fauna, relics of a golden age, which has survived in the depths of the Sahara Desert ».Even today, access to the Ennedi massif is difficult, and only a few rare nomads have been privileged enough to penetrate the heart of this astounding massif.

The Ghanaian women who live on a lagoon in Ada, mine for salt with their bare hands during the three month-long dry season. Ankle deep in brackish water, they bend, scoop, bag and tote the raw salt, often developing sores and swellings. But they are happy to have this seasonal work and their indomitable spirit shines through. They boast that the men would not be as skillful in collecting and cleaning the salt. Their families depend on the meager income from the sale of salt to provide food and clean water.Women have done this back-breaking work for the last three hundred years. Although they dream of improving their lives with their income, in the end they have to spend all of the earnings on sustenance. While the government has promised them clean water, it has yet to materialize. The soundtrack includes traditional work songs as well as an original song by Ghanaian musicians.

=505  00$aMade for the United Nations, this documentary chronicles the logging damage that has taken place in the forests of Finnish Lapland over the past 50 years. Home to the indigenous Saami peoples, these Northern old growth forests are essential to Saami reindeer herding, a traditional way of life that the Saami hope to continue into future generations. Population growth in Finland has created economic pressure - prompting migration to the Saami lands in the North. The resulting forest cutting severely depletes the lichen necessary for free reindeer grazing, and logging infrastructure disrupts the entire forest ecosystem.

=520  3\$aThis is the surprising tale of how a mountainous region in the Peruvian Andes came to adopt saxophone music as it was played in New York City in the big band era of the 40's and 50's. Here in the Montaro Valley, 10,000 feet above sea level, blues, jazz and rock and roll is interpreted in the rhythms and melodies of folkloric traditions. Every folk orchestra in the Peruvian central mountains has at least eleven or twelve saxophones, accompanied by a violin, a harp and one or two clarinets We see how the local musicians imitate the New York style of the big band era, wearing dark, beautifully tailored suits, Al Capone fedoras and neckties, often emblazoned with "I Love New York."In this poor rural area, weddings take on the magic and exuberance of the world of Garcia Marquez. The smallest wedding has at least two orchestras, with eighteen musicians each. The music never stops. The musicians accompany the bride, dancing through the streets of the village along with the guests.. This lively film is fascinating musical anthropology as well as a heart warming portrait of musicians passionate about their heritage, but also longing for recognition in the larger world.

=505  00$aThe films were made in the Anthropology Department of San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University at Northridge). Edmund Carpenter founded the department with the intention of moving anthropology beyond the book. He felt that the realities and insights of anthropology were often better represented in the arts than in scholarly texts and between 1957 and 1967 he led a flourishing and experimental department. In addition to cultural anthropologists, physical anthropologists and linguists, his faculty included folklorist Bess Lomax Hawes along with artists, musicians, animators and filmmakers.

=505  00$aLong ago, Earth was dominated by supernatural spirits living in the oceans. Man however, lived in perfect harmony with them, thanks to a sacred alliance he concluded with the marine mammals.Today however, throughout the world, exist ethnic minorities whose daily lives continue to bear witness to contemporary myths : these legends are their faith, and the animals, their gods.From the shark tamers of the Pacific to the crocodile hunters of the Australian reef, "Sea legends" reveals the most wondrous of beliefs which unite man and nature in the spectacular, thousand-year old fulfillment of a magical destiny.

=505  00$aThis is an innovative, intimate portrait of stalwart members of an indigenous people who inhabit Mexico's Sierra de Santa Marta and speak a derivative of ancient Olmec. For convenient classroom use, eight episodes, focussed on various aspects of their culture, have been divided into Parts I and II -- available separately.Part I begins with recollections of an outlawed carnival celebration intercut with old women performing "Dance of the Tiger" in honor of the corn god. Episode two: younger women collaborate, guided by Santana, in making a fuel-saving clay stove. Episode three moves to Apolinar's clinic for a group-cleansing, followed by his recital of a chant to restore a soul stolen by wily spirits called chanecos. In section four, Santana recounts her life-story.Part II begins with Don Tomas pouring libations to the rain god. Episode six finds us in a polygamous household. Episode seven dramatizes the popular story of Homshuk, the corn god, as Gabriel and his second wife labor in the fields. To conclude, the Arizmendi brothers revive ballads of the Sierra on homemade instruments.

=505  00$aThis is an inspirational documentary about a young Muslim woman, trained as an anthropologist, who suffered hardship and professional censure to save a desert tribe from becoming extinct in the harsh Sahara. The Bishari tribe had lived in the Sahara for 5,00 years, but were unknown to Egyptian authorities.The Bishari were living in a time warp, their warriors believing they were still the guardians of the ancient Roman gold mines. When the Aswan Dam was constructed, the Bishari's grazing ground became submerged. Anthropologist Shahira Fawzy discovered them by chance, suffering from illness and malnutrition.Going against the wishes of her traditional family, Shahira went to live among the Bishari. She studied their customs, fought the government bureaucracy on their behalf, and helped them develop skills such as irrigation, well digging and gardening. Her aim was to ensure that the tribe would maintain its unique culture while surviving in the modern world.Here is a documentary so exotic and fascinating that it has the aura of fiction. It will be memorable viewing in Anthropology, African Studies and Women's Studies programs.

=505  00$aSome animals have always fascinated mankind for their mystery and power. Crocodiles, snakes and sharks are feared as enemies in some cultures and admired as super beings in others. Whether part of our nightmares or greatest hopes, this fascination has pushed man to want to confront these great animals and has given birth to surprising legends and beliefs that still haunt us today.Impressive rituals, ceremonies and combat scenes are gathered into six incredible stories that explain the bond between tribal animals and human kind and why they are so present in our imaginations.

=505  00$aSiaka Diabaté is a musician at Bouaké, the second largest town in the Côte d'Ivoire. Through his mother's family he is Senufo, but through his father's ancestry he considers himself a Mande griot. He is a multi-talented professional musician, and for the local festivals plays five instruments: the Senufo and Maninka balafons, the kora harp, the dundun drum and the electric guitar. This film shows Siaka playing in the group led by Soungalo Coulibaly before his death in 2004, including the use of jembe drums, which we also see being made.Using long continuous shots that give priority to the music and to what Siaka and Soungalo have to say, this documentary introduces the audience to a fascinating world of urban music that incorporates traditional songs and dances by griots. Shot on site a few weeks before rising of civil war, during various festivities, this film presents a living portrait of this lovable and highly skilled musician working in a traditional environment, adding another dimension to the pleasure of seeing and hearing him during his international tours.

Every summer, Irina, a world-famous model, and her son travel back to help her troubled family, trapped in the new free market society struggling with alcoholism, lawlessness and despair. Through interviews with academics, local shamans, monks, musicians, and farmers, Siberian Dream shows the effects of perestroika and glasnost on this Buryat community.The Buryats are trying to develop an open society while struggling to revive their culture. Irina and her family embody these efforts. Buryat-Mongols -- including the Pantaeva family -- practice Buddhism and Shamanism simultaneously. Irina celebrates her endangered Buryat-Mongol culture, teaching her son the importance of honoring their ancestors.Dr. David Foglesong, Professor of Russian History at Rutgers, illuminates the effects of Russification and the events and personalities driving glasnost and perestroika. Dr. Robert Thurman, Professor of Religion at Columbia University and President of Tibet House, New York, discusses Tibetan Buddhism and history as it affected the Mongolian tribes to which the Buryats belong.

=505  00$aThis is a warm portrait of one of the most revered musical families in India, in which the cherished tradition of dhrupad vocal music is passed on from father to son. The Dagar brothers are handsome, affable young men at home in contemporary India. Yet they sit cross legged on a carpeted floor submitting to the instructions of their father, hour after hour, day after day, in order to master the complex tonalities of this demanding music. Their musical tradition has been passed on orally from father to son, kept alive for thousands of years without the aid of writing.Singing Between Two Worlds presents for the first time on film an in-depth look at the extraordinary approach to musical training fundamental to the classical music of India. This method is known as the guru shishya parampara. Through it, the Dagar brothers devote their lives to learning dhrupad vocal music, and strive to take their place among the twentieth generation of their family to have mastered this tradition. Viewers will gain an appreciation not only of the demands but also of the beauty of Indian classical music.

=520  3\$aThe shooting lasted only six tense days in June 1967, but the Six Day War has never really ended. Every crisis that has ripped through this region in the ensuing decades had its roots in these fateful days. On the 40th anniversary of the war, the region remains trapped in conflict.This war has long been seen by Israel as the miraculous victory of their "little state". . . this enclave surrounded by an "ocean" of tens of millions of Arabs from all over the Middle East. For the Arab states, this was a humiliating defeat suffered at the hand of imperialistic plotters. Our two-part film tells the true story of the Six Day War - beyond the images and propaganda clichés.40 years on, it is safe to say that the Six Day War was a key turning point in the history of the Middle East. It marked the end of the dream of a united Arab nation that would be free of the dominance of leading powers. After the defeat of the Arab states, the Palestinians came to realise that, henceforth, they would have to rely on themselves. The occupation by Israel of the West Bank and East Jerusalem further contributed to strengthen the sense of national identity of the Arabs of Palestine. The war sparked a profound religious awakening in Israel which ultimately triggered a rise in Islamic fundamentalism throughout the region.Finally, the events marked the beginning of a historical cycle that saw Israeli military victory lead to a tragic political deadlock that has been causing suffering for the people in the entire region ever since. To this very day, the return to pre-1967 war borders are still considered the condition for any peace plan based on the coexistence of an Israeli and a Palestinian state.This two-part documentary, shot in Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Syria, offers impressive choice of archives and an extraordinary amount of new testimonies from varied sources, from ordinary soldiers to generals, from politicians to secret service agents. Part One leads us onto the march to war, whereas Part Two concentrates on the war itself. In an in-depth analysis of history, the film offers a greater understanding of the key issues at stake today in the Middle East.

=505  00$aSome animals have always fascinated mankind for their mystery and power. Crocodiles, snakes and sharks are feared as enemies in some cultures and admired as super beings in others.Whether part of our nightmares or greatest hopes, this fascination has pushed man to want to confront these great animals and has given birth to surprising legends and beliefs that still haunt us today.Impressive rituals, ceremonies and combat scenes are gathered into six incredible stories that explain the bond between tribal animals and human kind and why they are so present in our imaginations.

=505  00$aThis is a loving and lively musical tribute to Ralph Rinzler, the man who championed indigenous American music, first as a musician, then in field research and recording, and finally as the founder of the Center for Folklife in the Smithsonian Institute.Beginning in the fifties, Rinzler sought out and encouraged folk musicians in the bluegrass, Cajun, shout and Native American traditions. In this film, performers such as Doc Watson, Pete Seeger, David Grisman, the Moving Star Hall Singers and Bernice Johnson Reagon, to name a few, throw heart and soul into song. They remember Ralph's friendship and support, as well as his enthusiasm for new talent.It was Ralph who convinced the Smithsonian Institute that a department should be created for American folk culture. Under his leadership, the Smithsonian produced the annual Folklife Festival and later purchased Folkway Records from Moe Ash, thus preserving American indigenous music for the enjoyment of future generations. The film is a rich tapestry of folk experience expressed in music and oral history. The civil rights movement, the labor movement, the troubles of farm workers, and the longing of immigrants - all these are expressed in the folk tradition Rinzler helped preserve.

The film, mainly set in Nicosia in 1983, shows the pressures of refugee economic recovery through shift work in a family bakery, and the pains of dislocation felt by Sofia in her laments which she sings at the intervals during the film. The film is powerful because the members of this large refugee family become individuals for the viewer, each with his or her dissatisfactions, illusions, and dreams. The film manages to go beyond merely viewing the hardships these people are trying to overcome to a thought-provoking glimpse into the dynamics of a family. The film is recommended for both secondary school and university courses that are concerned with refugees, Mediterranean anthropology, politics, gender, or psychology.

=505  00$aFolk healing has been part of the Mexican culture since pre-Columbian days. This tradition still flourishes in the Mexican American communities of the lower Rio Grande Valley. This film follows three healers in their daily work. Josefa, a traditional curandera, uses a variety of herbal and spiritual techniques. She is shown giving blessings, performing ritual cleansings and communicating the wandering soul of the dead man. Maria heals her patients by channeling the spirit of Mexico's most famous healer who died sixty years ago. Trini is a traditional partera, or midwife. She plays an important role in the community where one third of all births take place outside of the hospital. Filmmaker Monica Delgado is herself a descendant of a curandera and partera. These cameo portraits show how traditional beliefs flourish in Mexican American culture.

=505  00$aThis award-winning film is a lively portrait of a native people determined to survive the encroachment of the Western world. It features the Kuna Indians of Panama's San Blas Islands as they unite to protect their rainforest homeland, Kuna Yala, and the tradition it inspires. Told entirely in the words of the Kunas, the film is a plea to care for the earth from a people who have a deep and intimate relationship with the land. Today, the rapid destruction of tropical rainforests is recognized as a critical global problem. A tragic result of this process has been the extinction of countless indigenous peoples. The Kuna Indians are a striking exception to this scenario. We learn first hand how they reject the lure of westernization and reaffirm their own traditional values. The issues of conservation and cultural survival are complex, with no simple solutions. This film offers the hopeful message that the timeless wisdom of indigenous peoples has something vital to offer the Western world.

=520  3\$aWhen Annika is given an eagle feather by a Native American visiting Sweden, she realizes it is a sacred object which should probably not be in her hands. These days Native American ceremonies are being commercialized for "outsiders," arousing resentment in the Native community. Annika sets out to find the feather's rightful owner, a quest which takes her to American Indian communities in Albuquerque, San Antonio and to Bear Butte in South Dakota. She meets many Native Americans who are bitter, believing they are "the forgotten people." But others are fighting to preserve their culture and their faith as well as to protect their land.Navajo Andrew Thomas, who manages the Albuquerque Pueblo Center, explains that certain tribes use feathers in special ways to communicate with "the Upper God." He fears modern Native Americans have lost touch with the ancient beliefs. In this film we hear from a professor of Native American history in San Antonio who discusses the five hundred tribes who lived in the US centuries ago and recalls the massacres they suffered. Gayle Ross, a respected Cherokeeteacher, feels Americans do not understand native people. Arvol Looking Horse of the Lakota/Dakota/Nakota nation is deeply disturbed by the entire arena of cultural exploitation.

=505  00$aRoach has been living on the streets since age 14, he's rebellious, loud and defiant. As part of S.P.I.T., Roach has been given a camera to document his world. The footage he gets is urgent, because there's a war against squeegee kids. The RoachCAM is positioned behind enemy lines: living in derelict buildings, squeegeeing for money, being hunted by police. The viewer is forced to look at the living reality of Roach and his friends: Hungry on the streets in one of the world's most prosperous countries, classified as thugs, criminals, and enemies. These kids refuse to obey, assimilate, and conform to society's values - their beliefs and realities are scarred into their flesh in the form of piercing, tattoos, track marks, bruised veins, rotting teeth, gangrene, scurvy...S.P.I.T. shatters the windshield between Us and Them. Roach's camera acts as the hammer: hard, forceful, direct; impacting with the force of an actual life. Daniel Cross' camera documents the impact: recording the reflections of individual lives, mirrored upon the shards of flying glass.This is a collaborative film that seizes Punk's "do-it-yourself" ethos. Local punkers Deadly Pale, Locos and others contributed guttural emotion to the soundtrack. Artist Rick Trembles supplied an apocalyptic animation sequence from Roach's imagination. Youth and rebellion fuel this film.

Often Western medicine cannot cure them. This stunningly photographed film focuses on Sebim Odjo, who draws upon Moslem, Christian and traditional African beliefs in his healing ceremonies. He moderates disputes, tracks down the source of illness, and uses his powers to heal. We see a water cure used on a patient ill with spite.

=520  3\$aThe Split Horn chronicles the seventeen-year journey of a Hmong shaman and his family transplanted from the mountains of Laos to Appleton, Wisconsin. As a shaman, Paja Thao ministers to the physical and spiritual needs of friends and family with elaborate rituals that bridge the natural and spirit worlds. His young daughter's narration gives us insight into the transition from an Asian village to Middle America. To his dismay, Paja's children are losing touch with their family's ancient traditions as they turn to TV, computer games and Christianity. Only his youngest daughter, age fourteen, who studies Hmong traditional dance, seems interested in her culture. Paja's sixteen-year-old son, Xue, works at the local pizza parlor and spends most of this time with his American girlfriend. Paja's concern about family unity deepen when Xue reveals his girlfriend is pregnant. Paja's older children have started families of their own, turning to Christianity and severing ties to their ancient Hmong traditions.Seeing his family splinter causes Paja great sadness. He conducts a ceremony and while in trance, discover that his own soul has strayed from his body. He spirals into depression and is unable to heal himself or to perform rituals for others for a year. Ultimately, the crisis sets off a family and community response that helps restore the shaman's strength and reunites his family.

The boy plays on the shingle imitating the circling gulls, while the man stretches his thongs between rocks and scrapes away the fur. The woman dresses the seal, wasting nothing, braiding the intestines.

They eat a little frozen fish; then the hunter finishes his harpoon and sets out after seal. After a long imitative stalk, the hunter moves too soon, alerting the seal, and his harpoon misses. In camp the woman skins a flipper and the boy plays. The hunter prepares for a night vigil at the breathing hole of the seal. Next morning the woman scrapes a seal skin, the boy plays on shore, and the hunter still waits for the seal. When again he fails, he turns to egg collecting on the cliff where the gulls nest. Finally the family packs its belongings on a bear skin and shifts along the coast to another area.

=520  3\$aSultan Issa Maigari is the ruler of the northern Cameroon province of Adamawa, an area the size of England. Served by a liveried bodyguard of servants and slaves, he lives in an extraordinary thatched palace with his harem of wives and concubines and his thirty children. We are in a world of heraldry and magic, an ancient world fast disintegrating under the pressures of contemporary political forces. In 1992 the Sultan allowed anthropologist Lisbet Holtedahl, and award-winning director Jon Jerstad, to film his life. Never before had a traditional Islamic leader granted such access to a world that seems straight out of the Arabian Nights. We see the many problems besetting the Sultan, ranging from the threat of an armed rebellion among the peasant farmers, to his impossible task of justifying support for the national Christian goverment to his local Moslem subjects. His courtiers criticize his rule. His own Praise-Singer (surely the worst Praise Singer in Africa) contributes a bitter diatribe against the Sultan for his lack of generosity. The intrigues of the court are reminiscent of Shakespearean drama. Filmed as the first democratic elections in Cameroon were about to be held, The Sultan's Burden captures the myriad political and ethnic rivalries which occur all over Africa as it emerges from a colonial past.

=520  3\$aThis unique and highly visual documentary shows an ancient, sacred Apache ceremony that has never before been filmed. The Sunrise Ceremony which marks the passage from adolescence to adulthood for young Apache women, is disappearing under the pressure of cultural assimilation. This documentary focuses on 13-year-old Maureen Nachu, who lives on the Fort Apache Reservation, in Whiteriver, Arizona.It captures the elaborate preparations for the ceremony: the mystical rituals of the Medicine Man who presides over the dance, the spiritual purification rites in the "Sweat Lodge," and the secret midnight appearance of the "Crown Dancers." The Sunrise Dance is a tremendous physical test, lasting three days. It proves that Maureen has the courage and strength of character to take her place in adult society. For Maureen, her family and her community, the dance is a reaffirmation of tribal identity and the celebration of the role of women in Apache society.

Kami is a young Mustangi from the Jomsom region of Nepal, who is getting ready for the great race of Dzar.Kami and his entire family cross the Mustang mountains every year in the pleasant August weather. Their destination is Dzar, where the great horsemen's festival is held to pay the tribute to the defenders of Tibet, the proud Campas warriors.Mustang horses are thoroughbreds with tremendous breathing capacity and incredible endurance. They survive in altitudes of more than 4,000 meters, and are accustomed to the high mountains. For the big race, the riders consult the horse healers, a wise and highly respected caste.

=505  00$aThis fascinating film depicts the Taigana, an unusual tribe of nomads living in the mountainous Hovsgol region of Mongolia, near the Siberian border. Nomadism has deep spiritual meaning for the Taigana; their annual migration represents the cyclical nature of life to them and has profound sacred meanings. All their activities are dictated by the world of the spirits. They believe the valleys and mountains are inhabited by their forefathers and by the Supreme Divinity.The Taigana are entirely dependent on their reindeer. They use the sturdy animals to move along the same paths their ancestors did for hundreds of years. Each family owns ten to seventy reindeer which provide most of the diet of the Taigana. The meat is dried and preserved while the milk is used for drinking and making cheese. The skin is utilized to make clothing for the extremely cold winter. Unfortunately, in the mid-nineties the Mongolian government restricted theTaigana's movements with disastrous consequences. The tribe had to remain too long in their camps. As a result, reindeer waste increased, many reindeer sickened and died and forty per cent of the tribe contracted? gastroenterological illness and diseases of the joints. The tribe wrote a desperate letter to international aid organizations protesting their conditions and help was sent by International Crossroads and the Mongolian Red Cross. Their struggles continue to this day.

=505  00$aLife in a rural village in Mauritania is hard on women. Tradition and Islamic religion are intertwined to reinforce strict gender roles. The husband is the protector and keeper; his word is law. While the men take their ease, the girls and women are off to the fields during the peanut planting and harvest season, walking five miles each way, and coming home with heavy burdens from the fields to prepare the family dinner. They carry the water, sweep the yard, wash the clothes, and care for the children. This short, beautifully filmed video captures succinctly the subservience of women, while at the same time remaining respectful of tradition and culture. There are no drugs, alcohol or loneliness in this kind of community, where family bonds are very strong. We hear from several young Peace Corps workers in the village who are hopeful that by educating and thereby widening the horizons of young women, eventually women will have more choices. From a Western perspective, the future of Africa depends on education and family planning.

=505  00$aThis film captures the poignancy of a native people undergoing cultural change. When Susan Cornwell first encountered the Bedamini in Papua, New Guinea in 1971, they were aggressive and practiced cannibalism as part of their religion. She was able to befriend them and make a landmark film, Tidikawa and Friends. Now, on her return, she finds a people in Western dress, wearing T-shirts instead of nose bones. Many have been converted to Christianity. They perform their tribal dances for money, and use calculators to determine the charges. Susan shows them the old film and they respond with excitement to images of their former selves. The skillful intercutting of old and new footage dramatizes the effects of westernization on an indigenous people.

=520  3\$aMade in 1972, this film is concerned with the traditional trans-Himalayan trade which links the relatively low-altitude, grain-growing regions of Nepal with high-altitude Tibet, the traditional source of most of the salt and wool imported by Nepal. It also provides information about and illustration of the ways of life and the history of the diverse peoples in the areas through which the trade passes. In the past the economy of the mountain areas depended on the trade and even now, in spite of recent economic and political changes in the area, the trade is still significant although much diminished in quantity. In medieval times western Nepal and the adjoining areas of Tibet were included within a kingdom ruled by the Malla dynasty, and the film begins at Dullu, once the southern capital of the Malla kings. Inscriptions on stone monuments standing among ordinary village houses contain the genealogies of the Malla kings and have made possible the reconstruction of the history of that part of western Nepal.The film follows the trade-route ascending from Dullu to Jumla, the head-quarters of a district of the same name. This district is the home of high-caste Hindus, who penetrated into the hills at the time of the Muslim invasions of Northern India. The film shows the villages and agricultural methods of these mountain peasants, and the section devoted to the Nepali-speaking Hindu farmers living at altitudes between 5,000 and 10,000 feet contains also a long sequence of a shamanistic performance with several shamans dancing in a state of trance. We are shown life on the banks of Lake Rara, the largest mountain lake in Nepal, where descendants of the former Jumla rajas have found refuge. A crossing by a rope-bridge of the Mugu Karnali river leads into the Humla region where Hindu castes have intermingled with Mongoloid populations influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. The area of Buddhist people of Tibetan speech and culture is reached at altitudes of 12,000 feet and above, and the film illustrates the daily life, farming and yak-herding activities and some ritual performances of these populations. The inauguration of a newly-reconstructed Buddhist temple (gompa), presided over by a Tibetan reincarnate lama, gives a brief view of typical lamaistic ritual of Mahayana Buddhism. The next section deals with a Bhotia village close to the Tibetan border. From the Nara Pass (16,000 feet) the camera looks into Tibet towards Taklakot, once an important trade mart and the winter capital of the Malla kingdom. The film shows the arrival of a Tibetan trading caravan consisting of hundreds of sheep and goats carrying bags of salt which are to be bartered for Nepalese rice and barley. There are also sequences of yak-caravans moving along perilous mountain paths. The rest of the film is devoted to the illustration of the streams I of trading groups moving before the onset of winter to the lower regions of Nepal and of their arrival in the broad valleys of the foothills. A short final sequence of a festival in the Kathmandu valley illustrates by way of contrast the diversity of the cultural pattern of Nepal from Kwakiutl consultants.

=505  00$aSome animals have always fascinated mankind for their mystery and power. Crocodiles, snakes and sharks are feared as enemies in some cultures and admired as super beings in others.Whether part of our nightmares or greatest hopes, this fascination has pushed man to want to confront these great animals and has given birth to surprising legends and beliefs that still haunt us today.Impressive rituals, ceremonies and combat scenes are gathered into six incredible stories that explain the bond between tribal animals and human kind and why they are so present in our imaginations.

=520  3\$aIn the Gambia, West Africa, locals have a name for foreigners; they call them "Tubabs" a term derived from "two bob", the standard fee British colonialists used to pay Gambians for odd jobs. In this film we follow a group of students from St. Mary's College in Maryland on a summerlong jaunt deep into the Gambia to study West African language and culture. The result is a story about a group of American teenagers traveling outside their comfort zones in search of adventure, knowledge and self-discovery.The filmmakers investigate issues surrounding modern-day colonialism, Westerner's relationship to developing countries, and the traditions of the Gambian people. The film serves as a meditation on that familiar topic, the study-abroad experience, and like any travel experience, the film is most entertaining when things go wrong. The bus breaks down, the students get lost, a mission goes awry, and the very moments that are the most awful at he time end up being the most memorable. Anyone who spent time overseas during college or high school, will see a reminder of their travels in this film and recall a bit of the Tubab in themselves.

=505  00$aAnthropologist and psychologist Peter Elsass studied two Indian tribes in Colombia and Venezuela over a 16-year period. In his film, The Earth is Our Mother (Part I), we see their different ways of dealing with encroaching white civilization. The Motilon Indians in the lowland of Venezuela gave up their traditional ways and became dependent on the Catholic missionaries who converted them. They became spiritually and economically impoverished. The Arhuaco Indians, in the mountains of northern Colombia, threw out the missionaries and maintained their cultural integrity. They have an abiding spiritual attachment to their land. Films in this series: The Earth is Our Mother, The Journey Back (Part II)

=505  00$aIn Mexico's vast and astonishing Copper Canyon area of Chihuahua, isolated from much of the world, live the Tarahumara Indians. Descendants of the Aztecs who fled the Spaniards, they live without electricity in spectacularly beautiful but rocky land where farming is difficult and game is scarce. Poor, and without resources, they are torn between the lure of modern life and maintaining their age-old traditions.In an unprecedented way, the filmmaker was able, over a period of five years, to document the ways of these gentle and reticent people. She overlays Tarahumara folk tales with footage of day-to-day life. The candid observations of one old Indian who would rather have modern comforts than preserve his traditions in poverty, provides an ironic note. One of the revelations is that the people who are thought to be very reserved are actually playful and delight in gossip.

Hence the name "vampire fish".Alphan lives north of the Kenyan coast, on one of the wildest islands in the Lamu archipelago, the island of Kiwayu, on the edge of the Indian Ocean.He used to be a sailor on a tanker and travelled all of the world's oceans. He gave it up however, to come home and live with his people.

=505  00$aVoices of Orchid Island focuses on the Yami on Orchid Island, a small island located 45 miles off the southeast coast of Taiwan in the Pacific Ocean. The film explores the complex and often troubled relationship the Yami community has with the outside world by looking in detail at three different cases of "invasion" it has experienced.The film opens by directly addressing the suspicions the Yami have of outsiders. The visit of a Taiwan tour group to the island is fraught with cultural miscues, sometimes humorous in their absurdity, but there are also sobering hints of exploitation. By the end of this scene it is easy to understand why the Yami have forbidden tourists to photograph them. The second aspect the film deals with is the island's medical care. The film follows the one western-trained doctor on his rounds as he tries to introduce a basic level of modern medicine while confrontion a firmly entrenched set of local beliefs and traditions. Finally, the film documents the local anti-nuclear movement, the target of which is the nuclear waste dump the ROC government has built on the island. We hear representatives of the national govern- ment defend the site's safety while local people express their fears and concerns at having the site so near by. Woven throughout the film are views of Orchid Island's rugged, gorgeous scenery and its vibrant festivals.

=520  3\$aThis is a unique story of a leap across cultural boundaries as a Masai warrior from the pastoral valleys of southern Kenya adapts to life on the fast track in suburban Massachusetts. At age nineteen, Masai warrior Mpeti Ole Surum, met an American tourist on a safari in Kenya. This meeting changed his life forever. The American encouraged him to get an education and learn about the world beyond his valley. Changing his name to "Tom," he went to school and learned to read and write English. For several years he held different jobs at a resort, where he impressed guests by speaking about the Masai culture.Possessed of the courage and strength needed to kill lions, he also had the talent of a natural showman. Sent abroad to encourage tourism, Tom quickly became a sought after lecturer, entertainer and talk show guest. Today he has several agents booking his performances at schools and universities across the United States. Even the most complacent high school students sit up and take notice when Tom bellows tribal incantations across the stage while dressed in full hunting regalia.A self -styled cultural ambassador, Tom also shares what he has learned of America with young Masai. While he partakes of the bounty of American life, including Armani suits, a luxury car, and credit cards, he is still strongly attached to his tribe and its traditions.

=505  00$aThis ethnopsychiatric film shows the management of psychiatric disorders by the Yoruba of Nigeria. There are two basic types of institutions to deal with psychiatric disorders. First there are treatment centres managed by herbalists and diviners with specialist knowledge of traditional psychiatric therapy. Second there are cult groups that provide a setting for the expression of otherwise socially unacceptable behaviour through 'possession' and masquerade dances. The film shows a number of aspects of both types of institution, including sequences of male Gelede masqueraders and women of the Egun possession cult. In spite of the diversity of ethno-medical practices which are portrayed, the film has been criticised for not drawing sufficient distinction between major and minor forms of healing.

=505  00$aMade for the United Nations, this documentary chronicles the logging damage that has taken place in the forests of Finnish Lapland over the past 50 years. Home to the indigenous Saami peoples, these Northern old growth forests are essential to Saami reindeer herding, a traditional way of life that the Saami hope to continue into future generations. Population growth in Finland has created economic pressure - prompting migration to the Saami lands in the North. The resulting forest cutting severely depletes the lichen necessary for free reindeer grazing, and logging infrastructure disrupts the entire forest ecosystem.

Together with the Norwegian Coastguard we board Russian trawlers; we participate in the purchase of perpetual fishing rights in Icelandic waters; and we learn how Kenyan fishermen survive on the bones that are left after the flesh of the fish they catch has been exported to Europe. More, we see how the people of Mitiaro have shared their catches among themselves, to the benefit of all.

=505  00$aSome animals have always fascinated mankind for their mystery and power. Elephants, crocodiles, snakes, apes, big cats and sharks are feared as enemies in some cultures and admired as super beings in others.Whether part of our nightmares or greatest hopes, this fascination has pushed man to want to confront these great animals and has given birth to surprising legends and beliefs that still haunt us today.Impressive rituals, ceremonies and combat scenes are gathered into six incredible stories that explain the bond between tribal animals and human kind and why they are so present in our imaginations.

=505  00$aAmong the Senufo people of northern Côte d'Ivoire, the balafon (xylophone with calabash resonators) is an emblematic musical instrument. Balafon makers are all musicians, but a balafon player isn't necessarily an instrument maker. The film shows in detail the manufacture of this musical instrument, an indispensable element in the life of the Senufo people. Each step is shown, from the initial prayer to the genies of the balafon before felling a tree, through the cutting and tuning of the keys and the resonators, to the fixing of the buzzing membranes, which give this instrument its very characteristic timbre. Nanga, the balafon maker, talks about his work and discusses different aspects with friends during a meal.

=505  00$aLong ago, Earth was dominated by supernatural beings: spirits who lived in the forest and in the ocean. To live in harmony with them, Man had to learn to respect nature and animals. Today the Masters of the Spirits are the guardians of ancient beliefs uniting men and animals: by respecting these eternal legends, Man continues to live incredible adventures with animals, hoping to receive the spirit`s protection. For its 13 extraordinary and true stories, the series entitled "The Master of the Spirits" has sought out civilizations who still believe in magic, and whose people continue to share remarkable experiences with animals, hoping to win the favor of the spirits. From the mysterious fishermen of the Himalayan rivers to the last eagle tamers of the Kirgisthan mountains, this collection recounts the most beautiful legends featuring exceptional relationships between Man and animals.

=505  00$aFor centuries, a veil of mystery has shrouded the ancient land of Yemen to the outside world, hiding both is fascinating tribal customs as well as its nationwide addiction to the controversial plant qat. This film explores the Yemeni culture and its dependency on qat, whic plays a central role in daily life, marriages and tribal disputes. Although banned outside Arabia, Qat recently surfaced in on the streets of London and New York. With the explosive expansion of its use worldwide, there is fierce international debate over its allegedly addictive properties. The film follows the Qat trail from its origins in Arabia. Focusing on a central character, the film tells the story of a powerful Qat trader and addict who is about to get married. His wedding is overshadowed by a bitter dispute over his Qat growing fields. What threatens to be a full blown clan war is peacefully resolved through chewing Qat.

=505  00$aThis is the story of a remarkable Canadian-American missionary couple who settled, in 1929, among the Montagnard tribes of Vietnam's central highlands. For 50 years, Gordon and Laura Smith lived there, preaching, working to open leprosariums and orphanages, and compiling a unique archive of diaries, books, photographs, and 16 mm films that record a fascinating way of life that has now vanished. The full sweep of 20th century Vietnamese history is conveyed in these images of French colonialism, Japanese invasion, and American intervention. Interwoven with archival footage and traditional music are interviews with surviving Montagnards and Dr. Gerald Hickey, the foremost American anthropologist on Montagnard cultures. Produced and directed by the Smith's grandson, an EMMY Award-winning filmmaker, Vietnam Mission examines many little-known facets of foreign involvement in Vietnam and examines the impact of missionary work on ethnic groups ravaged by events outside their control.

Following the rhythm of the four seasons of a wine grower's year, Vineyard Chronicle shows us the work, the worries and the joys of a family of wine growers and producers, the Potterats of Lavaux, Switzerland. Three generations who live and work together, keeping up old-time traditions.Techniques may have changed and know-how may have improved, but the pitched region of Lavaux has seen relatively little mechanization due to the small size of the holdings. The love of a job well done is what sets these "gardeners of the vine" apart, with their delight in healthy grapes and the need to see and touch what they produce.

Their priests are called daba. Among the few old shamans who are still living today, Dafa Luzo is the most remarkable. As the main character in the film, we see him looking after his farm and his family, as well as performing rituals to expel all unclean spirits and demons and honour the ancestors. His main worry, and his greatest hope, is to make sure his knowledge is safely handed down to the next generation.

The film follows NyaSeme, a married mother and grandmother in her late 30s, during the last month of her pregnancy and through the first weeks of her newborn daughter's life. The first part of the film focuses on everyday life in NyaSeme's home, as well as on the work of the anthropologists in the home, who themselves are expecting a child, which is born shortly after NyaSeme's. The second part follows the various small illnesses that the child, goes through. NyaSeme employs the herbal resources of the bush surrounding the home as well as those of the government dispensary; simultaneously, Otto, the anthropologists' son falls ill and receives various forms of medical treatment. The film creates a personal account of a woman's life, motherhood, children and the maintenance of bodily health in rural western Kenya, as well as insights into the reflexive and relational nature of ethnographic fieldwork.

They are the Baaka pygmies, who sing and dance to appeal to the spirits of hunting and honey gathering. Their life is a never-ending song that expresses their intense spirituality and their deep communion with the forest. Produced under the High Patronage of Unesco, this film follows the daily lives of a group of Baaka, who live only of hunting, honey gathering and singing. Our aim is to present this unique culture, and to show that if it were to disappear, the world would be poorer for it

It is time for Wario to learn the difficult trade of salt labor, in order to become a full-grown Borana with adult responsibilities. He will first follow his father to the "mouth of the devil", a volcano in which men risk their lives to extract salt. He will then journey to the singing wells, where men form a 30 ft chain to fetch water as they sing. With the camels packed with salt and water, father and son will embark on the salt route, a long and perilous journey across the desert.

From the negotiations to the construction of the new houses, the film shows how the authorities and the population try to recreate the village identity. The situation of the village of Aldaia da Luz reflects a mutating society.

=505  00$aA once unremarkable site of multi-faith pilgrimage to a Sufi Saint has been transformed and its local history rewritten - the film documents the journey of Charlotte, a student undertaking her PhD research in India, who, whilst researching religious pilgrimages, stumbles upon the politicisation of a pilgrimage site in western India. The research suggests that the pilgrimage site of Kalo Dungar or Black Mountain, situated in the Rann of Kutch, Gujarat, provides a micro-example of current political issues in India today, where by the 'unity in diversity' of the country is slowly being broken-down destroying any hope of communal peace.

=505  00$aThis documentary is made by Andy Lawrence in collaboration with independent midwife Judith Kurutac. They met in Kurutac's thirteenth year of practice when she supported Lawrence's partner, Helen Knowles (Birth Rites' curator), through the birth of their second child at home. For Kurutac the collaboration was a chance for film to capture the important relationship between a woman and her attendant in pregnancy and birth. The film is a personal journey, examining the roles the collaborators play as father and midwife, stimulated by their engagement with two couples who encounter very different experiences of birth. The film draws us into an examination of the connection between birth and death to explore what role fear plays in childbirth and how the ways in which we deal with fear affect the way in which a child is born.

=505  00$aBreeding Cells is a film from the laboratory of reproduction. A fertility clinic is a place where human reproduction is separated from sex and anatomized into bio/technological components. There fertilization is made visible and manipulable on a cellular level while the couples themselves seem to become marginal participants in a process that involves a large number of different professionalized agents and technologies.Recorded in the ward of reproductional medicine at Charite Hospital Berlin, this documentary approaches a scientific environment with an experimental ethnographic gaze. The filmmakers meet an open and quite unexcited "fertility team", who consider themselves simply ãassistants of nature. But what is nature in a hospital environment that is highly regulated by procedural methods, doctors conventions and conservative laws? Closely describing the routines and moral concerns of the medical staff, the film is portraying a transition time, when biotechnological science fiction is turning into everyday life.

=505  00$a"Business Process Outsourcing" is the fastest growing industry in the world. In India, approximately 350,000 people are currently working in call centres to maintain the contact between western companies and their customers. Vikhee Uppal is one of them. From a busy office in Calcutta, he pretends to be a guy named Ethan Reed and calls Americans, Brits and Australians to try and sell them cell phones and subscriptions. Vikhee hopes to make it in this sector. On the bulletin board, we see that he and his colleagues keep track of who sells the most. The Americans are the most impolite: they yell at the salespeople and hang up on them. The English, on the contrary, are the most willing to listen to their sales pitch. Even though Vikhee pretends to be a westerner at work, Indian traditions remain very important for him. He wants to get married to a girl from Punjab, and if he doesn't succeed, his family will find a bride for him. At work, Vekhee gets tutored in English. Each night, he watches English soccer matches to see what the people on the other end of the line actually look like.

=505  00$aEvery winter, over a period of six days, the lamas of Lingthem's village monastery hold their annual cham. These dramatic ritual masked dances impart elementary Buddhist teachings while providing entertainment to villagers. Their main purpose is to remove obstacles and ward off misfortune for the village, its inhabitants and the monastery. However, for lamas and more serious Buddhist practitioners, these cham and their rituals hold deep philosophical meanings. The dances were beautifully filmed by Dawa Tsering Lepcha in his own village monastery in the Lepcha reserve of Dzongu, North Sikkim. In the course of this village event, the deities who emerge in the period between death and rebirth make their rhythmic appearances followed by the Lord of Death who judges one's good and bad deeds in the after life. This film is the second produced by the Namgyal Institute of Tibetology as part of its visual anthropology project. This training program for indigenous filmmakers aims to produce a documented video record of Sikkim's vanishing indigenous and Buddhist cultures. Its primary purpose is to record and preserve the meaning and proper performance of Sikkim's rituals within their social and economic context.

=505  00$aIn Digoli, a small village in the Indian Himalayas, "magical" rituals and arranged marriages remain a common part of the mountain culture. But with the arrival of mobile phones, the extension of the radio relay system, and the exodus of men to the cities, modernity has begun to exert its influence.One beacon of Digoli's newfound innovation is the development of Avani, a cooperative that produces delicate silk. For fifteen years, Avani has enabled women to become socially and economically independent. Hema, one member of the co-op, finds herself torn between a traditional lifestyle working in the fields to provide food for her parents, and the opportunity to weave silk for Avani. Hema is chosen to travel to New Delhi to sell silk, but ultimately chooses to returns home. At age twenty-nine, when she's considered too old for marriage, she weds a jobless poor man named Harish. Without property, cattle, or money, they move to a remote village, but Avani soon proposes that Hema start a weaving center to teach locals, including her husband. Filmmaker and noted artist Catherine Addor-Confino punctuates the film with her vivid paintings, adding an imaginative element to this inspiring story of one woman's entrepreneurial spirit.

Although her fieldwork has been criticised, she was nevertheless one of the foremost fieldworkers of her day. In America, Bali and New Guinea she examined child development, sex and temperament to see what role society has in making people what they are. Adolescence was a time of emotional stress and personal conflict in America and Europe. Mead claimed that in Samoa, adolescence was in many ways the most enjoyable and happy time of life.

=505  00$aCemeteries are not only places for the dead. They are also spaces in which the living interact with each other - and with the dead. "Cultivating Death" depicts the different ways in which bereaved people remember and commemorate their deceased family members and friends, by visiting and tending their graves at a Victorian cemetery in London. It is a common belief in the West that the bereaved have to 'let go' and 'get over the loss' of their deceased kin, in order to return to a 'normal' life. In contrast to these cultural norms, many survivors maintain strong social relationships with their dead. "Cultivating Death" portrays some visitors of Kensal Green Cemetery in West-London, as they actively sustain these continuing bonds by arranging and tending the graves of their deceased, talking to them and bringing them gifts. They thereby speak frankly about this important aspect of their mourning for which the cemetery constitutes a unique environment.

In 1989, the Huehuetla Totonacs formed the Organización Independiente Totonaca (OIT), and joined in an electoral alliance with the Partido de la Revolución Democratica (PRD). For ten years the OIT and the PRD carried out a non-violent revolution. The visible signs of this Totonac renaissance are the health clinics, schools, roads, drinking water and electricity. But the real change is in the new self-confidence and pride of the Totonacs themselves. The camera follows Cruz Garcia, an "expatriate" Totonac, as he returns to his community.

Both sections would be excellent as teaching aids, particularly when accompanied by appropriate literature. The cinematography is stunning, evoking a strong mixture of the power of the environment-the expanse of the desert and grasslands-and the will of the people who live there. The Grasslands follows the life of a nomadic Mongol family on their year's journey following their herds across northern China. This section portrays a traditional view of Mongolian life. The second part of the film, The Desert, gives a more contemporary view of Mongols attempting to reclaim the desert in the more sedentary lifestyle currently encouraged by the Chinese government. This second section brings in disturbing environmental questions regarding the destruction of these northern grasslands.

The six part series was filmed all over the world, from the frozen Canadian Arctic to the dry outback of Australia, from New Guinea to India, Africa to the South Pacific. The programme makers retraced the steps of the pioneering anthropologists in those countries and, by following the life story of each scholar, they reveal how social anthropology has contributed to our lives.

=505  00$aThis film, made for Channel Four Television's Fragile Earth series, follows two American irrigation scientists who are seeking to understand the ancient Balinese irrigation system and forestall further environmental problems. Using traditional methods of cultivation, a single plot of irrigated land can produce tons of rice, year after year, century after century, with no added fertilizer and no ecological degradation. To understand why, biologist Jim Kremer takes us into the paddies with laboratory tools, showing how the rice pond becomes a miniature aquatic ecosystem which produces abundant energy for the plants, and how "development" can threaten this careful balance.Working with anthropologist Steve Lansing, Kremer has created a computer simulation model, which shows how a system of water temples manages irrigation along two Balinese rivers. The temple system is based on the belief that all water is a gift from the Goddess of the Crater Lake. In the name of the Goddess, temple priests possess the power to settle disputes over water rights or to grant permission for a village to construct a new irrigation tunnel. With the aid of the computer model, we can easily understand how the chains of water temples form a connected system of terrace management. The priests have shown themselves to be brilliant water engineers.Finally we return to the threat to the island's water ecology posed by modern development projects. We follow the two scientists as they present the computer to the Temple of the Lake Goddess. The interactive programme is written in the Indonesian language, and is designed to be used by the Balinese to explore the consequences of changes in their irrigation systems. A representative of the Asian Development Bank, which was initially hostile to criticism of its projects, has agreed to be interviewed as to how their thinking might change as a result of this research project. And the World Bank has now asked for assistance in developing ways to study similar systems elsewhere in the world.

Her Nephew, who is also a shaman's son, converted to Christianity some months ago and is now preaching the visions. And for him, if the visions come from God, the visions of the shamans inevitably must come from Satan. Through the Christian concepts of sin and original fault, good and evil notions are revised, The traditional healing practices of the shamans are heavily under attack. Under our eyes a fight between two worlds of religious conceptions is taking place.

=505  00$aThe 'Barolong boo Ratshidi' are one of the group of Tswana peoples, who together form a culturally homogeneous population of over two million. The Barolong themselves number about 75'000 and are one of the southernmost of the Tswana chiefdoms. The international boundary between South Africa and Botswana now divides this formerly united nation into two political communities, the smaller in south-east Botswana and the larger in the northern Cape Province of South Africa where this film was made. After the Union of South Africa was created in 1910 the Barolong were rapidly incorporated into the wider national economy. Soon, most adult males were compelled to enter the migrant labour market and were exposed to the cultural melting pot of the burgeoning industrial cities. Yet, despite rapid change in their social horizons, they were restricted, like other blacks, from any meaningful participation in white urban culture and its political institutions. Not surprisingly cultural change among the Baralong has been markedly uneven and the selective adoption of western forms has been accompanied by a perpetuation of much of their traditional corpus of belief and practice. The cultural diversity is perhaps most dramatically exemplified in the context of ritual and cosmology. The Barolong share the keenness of other black peoples in southern Africa for assimilating elements drawn from the various Christian denominations with which they have made contact. The chiefdom accommodates numerous churches, each comprising a number of individual congregations. Religious organisations here are prone to rapid subdivision, the splinter groups retaining the emphasis upon elaborate ritual and uniform, and upon complicated leadership hierarchies which are found in the parent churches.  Leaders in those churches are widely regarded as the educated elite; but while they formally condemn traditional ritual practice, nearly all Barolong continue to conduct their lives in terms of traditional cosmology. Beliefs in sorcery, pollution and ancestral potency flourish, and are expressed in the ritual of most the churches.The film examines Barolong religious syncretism in the context of the modern socio-political predicament. Two main types of religious organisation may be distinguished: the larger churches, whose form approximates that of the original mission church; and the smaller, highly factious groups, whose structure and ritual activities combine American fundamentalism with indigenous practice.The film attempts to show how seemingly irrational belief and action make sense when viewed in their proper context. The apparently bizarre syncretistic religion of the Barolong can be seen as part of the universal human quest to impose order and meaning upon everyday experience.

=505  00$aThese videos were edited from seven hours of Super 8 film shot by John Baily during two years of ethnomusicological fieldwork carried out in the Herat region of western Afghanistan between 1973 and 1977. The footage was transferred and edited at the TV Unit of Queen's University Belfast 1981-82. The non-synchronous sound is a problem at certain moments, but overall the editing has made the best of the image and sound available. All three films have a substantial amount of voice-over commentary. The films are of special interest because of the damage suffered by this region during many years of civil war. (This is the city referred to so poignantly in Baily's later film Amir.) The Annual Cycle of Music in Herat includes performances of a variety of traditional genres of music and dance. These include sha'er-s (poets) exchanging extemporised quatrains, sorna and dohol (shawn and drum), dutar (long-necked lute) band, nai chaponi (shepherd's flute), chahartar (long-necked lute), male singer with daireh (frame drum) and Chelu musicians singing and playing sarang (fiddle), tal (small cymbals) and daireh. Dances include atan, aushari and chub bazi.

(This is the city referred to so poignantly in Baily's later film Amir.) Using Paul English's paper 'The Traditional City of Herat' as a starting point, The City of Herat sets out to describe systematically the organisation of urban space. The film contrasts the old city and its traditional businesses, against the new city with its modern shops and workshops, and surrounding villages absorbed into the expanding town.

This series gives a picture of everyday life, during the four seasons the film crew lived with the main characters, consisting of three generations of members of the Archemku family. The first part, Hundreds of Homes, relates the story of Sasha Archemku and his family. He is the leader of Sovchos Brigade No. 6 which actually consists of his closest family members and some temporary helpers. They move throughout the taiga with their herd of reindeer in the traditional Evenki way. Each year the family sets up "home" in more than ten different campsites

=505  00$aLumina amintirii explores evocations of memory in contemporary post-socialist Bucharest, nearly twenty years after the fall of Romanian communism. The film is shot in Cismigiu Gardens, one of the oldest public parks in Bucharest. Interweaving recollections of the past with glimpses of present-day scenes from the park, the film constructs a montage of stillness and motion, images and voices, landscapes and people. Tracing paths through both the mind and the city, it invites viewers to activate their own memories and imaginations along with those unfolding in the film.

=505  00$aShot in Cameroon and Brussels, Je ne suis pas moi-même examines the complex network surrounding the international market of African antiquities, and the contradictions in a European art market hungry for new tribal objects. Where do the African masks come from? What journey do these masks make before their unveiling in the windows of the biggest galleries or art collections in Europe? Who determines the economic and aesthetic value of these objects now that colonialism is supposedly dead? And then there's a continent called Africa, in need of economic resources and therefore willing to sell its cultural heritage or, if need be, to fake it. The authenticity of the objects becomes blurred when the people that once adored them start to sell them.

Together, they travel by foot across the mountains, from village to village to heal those in need. The Kallawayan ancestral medicine is today threatened. Its safegard will only come from transmission, and thanks to people like Max and Johnny, it has a chance to survive.

=505  00$aKusum is a 14-year-old Indian girl. She lives and attends school in Delhi. Kaushal, her father, drives a motorised rickshaw and works his fingers to the bone to support his family. Sumitra, Kusum's mother, is about to have a baby. Kusum's family is poor, but their life isn't too bad, until Kusum falls ill. She isolates herself, she has raving fits and she refuses to eat properly. Her family takes her to see a doctor, but no physical illness can be found. It's evil spirits, say the neighbours. Kusum, Kaushal and Aunt Suman journey to the neighbouring town of Hapur, where Bhagat the healer lives. Bhagat is well-known throughout the region, and people travel hundreds of miles to see him. Bhagat's methods include conversation, rituals and herbal treatments. Joint trance sessions in which spirits talk constitute the core of his methodology. Should a patient fail to enter a trance, Bhagat's assistant Meena takes the spirits into herself and is entranced on behalf of the patient. Bhagat examines the family and orders treatment.

=505  00$aFour million Tiv people form the major culture of the Benue state of southern Nigeria. They are popularly known as the greatest democrats in Africa as their society is based on fraternal cooperation between age mates rather than on authoritative chieftaincy. Men of an age work together on communal farming and house building and celebrate their achievements with feasts famed for the excellence of their music and dance. Their women create amongst the greatest dances in Nigeria within their extended family compounds. Each year, during the dry season, when there is little farm work, the leaders of the dance teams compose songs to record recent experiences and new features in their lives which they express in the rhythms and gestures of their dance. This flare for continuous invention reached great heights of creativity in the Tiv storytelling drama known as the Kwagh-hir. Kwagh-Hir (literally meaning "something magical") is a traditional Nigerian puppet theatre show of the Tiv tribe of central Nigeria. The Kwagh Hir performance is a mixture of: Storytelling, poetry, puppetry, music, dance, and drama. Traditionally the Kwagh-Hir group has consistently been organised into four different categories which are: the management, the musicians, the performers and the sculptors. There is normally a role that is suitable for different members of the entire community. An elderly man usually tends to be the leader of the Kwagh Hir group the Ter-u-Kwagh-Hir meaning father of Kwagh Hir. His job is to organise the group and settle any differences or disputes that may arise.

=505  00$aAbu Lafi is an old Bedouin from Petra. He comes from the Bdoul community, and is from one of the last families to live inside the archeological site of Petra. But in recent years, the desert traditions have slowly been lost and the Bedouins are loosing their identities. In order to preserve his cultural heritage, Abu Lafi will initiate his 9-year-old grandchild, Zed, to become a real Bedouin, in the pure traditional style. Being a Bedouin starts with learning to train and mount a camel. Zed's challenge will be to set off for Mount Aaron, Petra's highest peak. If he succeeds to the top, Zed will be a true camel-driver, and will thus participate in the safeguarding of the Bedouin tradition of Petra and Wadi Rum.

=505  00$aThis film follows a remarkable clash between cultures in the South Pacific. It is the story of two men, both navigators, who are attempting to come to terms with a changing world.For one, American navigator Stephen Thomas, the film traces his extraordinary experience as he leaves the US east coast to find deeper meaning and greater skills on one of the most isolated of the Micronesian islands. Forgoing all his learning based on compass, maps, mathematical calculation, professional forecasts, radio, etc., Stephen spent nine months learning to use traditional island methods that in the past enabled the Satawal islanders to travel vast distances in outrigger canoes across dangerous, typhoon- and shark-ridden seas.The other navigator, the `last navigator' of the title, is Piailug. He is the most experienced and venerated navigator on the island. His craft is as much a way of life as a means of travel and he has watched with anguish the beauty and importance of island navigation dying away as his society becomes inexorably drawn into a world of modern communication. According to the film-maker, he agreed to teach Stephen Thomas because he hoped it would be a means of preserving and recording his traditional methods. Ironically, Stephen's presence provoked and brought into the open the anger and jealousy between Piailug and his vision of the importance of tradition, and the younger islanders who prefer to learn about modern techniques from the Americans.For Piailug, this voyage is a final journey of protest. Across 500 miles of sea via the Mariana straights, he takes a crew including Stephen Thomas from the traditional island of Satawal to the modernised tourist centre of Saipan where his people are fully immersed in a new and different culture.It was with Saipan that Piailug's ancestors traded before the Spanish conquest. It was a precarious and dangerous route across the deepest part of the world's ocean, but which resulted in many Caroline Islanders settling in Saipan and forming permanent links between the two communities. Piailug reconstructs the voyage his ancestors made as a symbolic gesture of the importance of his islands' traditions, particularly the navigational traditions.The journey is a symbolic link between the new and the old, highlighting what the Carolinians are losing and the new world they are joining. Produced for Channel Four Television's Fragile Earth series, this film won the `Rassengna Internazionale du Documentary del Mare' (silver medal) in Sardinia.

=505  00$aIn 1998, a new movement swept through Kuria, in S.W. Kenya with dramatic effect. Cattle raiding fuelled by the increasing presence of guns had led to a situation of total insecurity, with all in fear of the thieves. In April of that year, a group of men in just one location, Bukira East, effected a new organisation merging ideas from the Tanzanian vigilante movement, sungusungu, with their own indigenous assembly, the iritongo. Within a year the movement had spread throughout Kuria and the District as a whole was at peace. This film revisits the iritongo movement ten years later. In telling the story of its origin, and its current operation, it reveals a broad contrast between the areas where the iritongo still operates, though with some difficulty, and those where it has faltered and died. In these latter areas there has been a revival of clan raiding and warfare. The film is observational in style, with the situation described through the words of the participants, emphasizing their agency. There is, thus, extensive use of sub-titles.

=505  00$aBradford is a mill town in the north of England with a population of some 350,000 people of whom about 60,000 are Asians, predominantly Muslim Asians. Lessons from Gulam is a detailed study of musical enculturation and education within this Muslim community. Gulam Musa comes from Gujarat (India), and is a member of the Khalita group whose traditional caste occupations include those of barber and musician. In Bradford he is a music teacher and singer of qawwali, a form of Muslim devotional music found in India and Pakistan and also a genre of media-disseminated popular music. He runs an amateur qawwali group (called Saz aur Awaz, `Music and Song'), usually training his accompanists, and also takes part in Asian music workshops in the schools of Bradford. Lessons from Gulam explains several aspects of Asian music, especially drumming, and contrasts musical education in the school with what goes on in people's homes. It has long shots of musical performance, filmed and edited in the observational style, presented as the narrative of a visit to Bradford, and shows the film-maker getting his own lessons from Gulam.The film-maker is an ethnomusicologist and his musical knowledge is revealed in the detail and attention paid to the specifics of this Indian music style. Such insight is rare in ethnographic films and makes this film particularly valuable for music teachers and for teachers at both the school and university level who wish to expose students to the multi-cultural elements of music in Britain today.John Baily made this film at the National Film and Television School during his training as an ethnographic film-maker under the scheme organised by the Royal Anthropological Institute and the National Film and Television School and funded by the Leverhulme Trust.

More than 90 percent of them have been involved in the slate production at Alampu. This film includes technical details about slate production in the mountainside mine, and how the slate is worked prior to distribution. In the film we see the social relationships, co-operation between the miners, and the intimacy of the mining families. Strong women perform the tough and arduous work alongside the men. They have to carry heavy slate loads far to sell them. The film also describes the socio-cultural life of the village and its interaction with the environment. The activities of the men and women in the mine, as well as in the village, have an almost poetic dimension. (Material Culture and Archaeology Film Prize 2007)

The village has no electricity and still uses an ancient ganat system, using a 1,500-year old Byzantine 520 meter water tunnel, as its main source of water. However decades of migration and family conflicts have caused the tunnel's maintenance to be ignored. Muhammad Musa cleans the tunnel to safeguard the water supply. This renovation is part of an applied anthropological action research being implemented by ICARDA.

In Europe, most North African families will include someone who is undergoing this kind of disorder, with diverse manifestations (asthma, paralysis, epilepsy, "crises", sterility etc.) which, if left untreated, may be extremely serious and destructive, causing suffering and delinquent behaviour. In the film we follow two Moroccan women: Hind and Fatima who are looking to solve their problems caused by invisibles. They are visiting healers in Europe and Morocco. The healers "negotiate" with invisible forces and are using therapeutic rituals.

In the village of Kashushu, this Mukanda ceremony is 500 years old and has been passed down orally for generations. Patrick, the main organizer this year, has to raise money for costumes, food and for the 4 months of initiation. But the celebration is so expensive that Patrick struggles to meet both ends. He fears for the future of the Mukanda, and without the help of an organization like UNESCO, it will certainly disappear.

=505  00$aManenberg is a coming-of-age story about two young 'Cape Coloureds' struggling to make sense in the ruins of a post-apartheid South African township. Manenberg is a suburb outside Cape Town, which was constructed during the apartheid-regime to house coloured families with low incomes. Today it is a worn-down and overpopulated ghetto-area with enormous social problems, where the chances of becoming a gangster are greater than the chances of creating something new in the ruins of the past - but it is also an area with strong ties between the inhabitants in the claustrophobic houses. Based on 5 years of ongoing anthropological research in the area, the film invites the audience behind the headlines and into the lives of Warren and Fazline and their families. It is an intimate film about coming of age amidst difficult surroundings, about families, about life and its conflicts. It is a film about everyday life and dreams of the future. Manenberg is the debut documentary film by directors and anthropologists Karen Waltorp and Christian Vium, who have lived and done extensive research in Manenberg since 2005.

=505  00$aThis film is a valuable treatment of archival footage that George Milner shot while conducting field research in 1955 and 1959. The footage (eighteen minutes of the total film) focuses on traditional Samoan activities, such as fishing, cooking, house-building, hand-weaving, and bark-cloth making in preparation for the formal installation (saofa'i) of a Samoan matai (a male titleholder responsible for the welfare, prosperity and good behaviour of his extended family). This is one of the most important Samoan rites of passage. The ceremonies which validate his assumption of a new status are shown, both within the extended family and at the level of the village, whose existing titleholders formally acknowledge the new matai's right to a seat in council. Their approval is marked by the acceptance of gifts of goods and valuables, especially fine mats, which are of great importance. The musical sound track is of traditional songs recorded during the same period. Christina Toren, a South Pacific specialist, then interviews Reverend Lalomilo Kamu, a Samoan scholar currently at the University of Birmingham, about the previous footage and Samoan customs. In particular they discuss the formal preparation of a bowl of kava; the role of the taupou (ceremonial village virgin); the making of sinnet, the braided cord made from the fibres of coconut husk; the role of Samoan houses; cooking; the informal schooling of the young; the preparation of bark-cloth; and the process of hand-weaving. The interview provides a rare opportunity for viewers to hear a scholar from a filmed group comment on and explain the symbolism behind the pictures captured by the camera. The interview is quite detailed and is particularly useful for specialists in Polynesia or other regions of the South Pacific.

As a socialist he feels confused by the 'crazy' democracy and the uncertainties of the transition period. The couple's combined pensions amount to {dollar}66.00. Ephtim experiences constant difficulties in balancing the family budget. Free medical care and lunches at a subsidised canteen are essential to his survival strategy. This portrait of a Bulgarian pensioner is presented in the context of a global hopelessness and a clearly felt nostalgia for the communist past.

=505  00$aIn the Mongolian steppes, a family of horse herders welcomes four city children for several months. They have come to learn the Morin Khuur, an ancestral fiddle, and the untamed nature of the plains are a great source of inspiration. Omba, a wise old musician, teaches them this magical instrument, said to have healing powers. Back in their hometown, the children will continue playing the horse head fiddle, assuring the continuation of a great oral custom.

=505  00$aBronislaw Kaspar Malinowski was born into an aristocratic family in Poland in 1984. It was the chance reading of Frazer's Golden Bough that put him on the path of his future career. He pursuit anthropological training at London School of Economics and was awarded a doctorate for work on Australian Aborigines, based on data provided by Spencer and Gillen. Following a first field study among the Mailu off the New Guinea cost, using the well-tested formula of his predecessors, Spencer and Rivers, he moved 1915 to the Trobriands. There he abandoned the veranda and developed his style of fieldwork, which came to be called participant-observation: speaking the language, living in the community and becoming part of it, making a detailed record of all aspects of native life. Malinowski's intimate experience with Trobriand society generated a growing awareness of the myriad of links that hold society together.

In Turin, a northern Italian city, an abandoned clinic has been squatted by more than 200 refugees since December 2008. Khaled, Shukri and Ali have been travelling through this hell in order to arrive in Italy. They crossed the border and are determined to have a normal life. Their hopes crash with a life condition "suspended". The film follows their stories over the years, showing life in the clinic, including the inevitable internal problems, the protests of citizenship and the initiatives of the City. The cold winter, unbearable sultry August, until the evacuation of the former clinic by the city authorities and the transfer of refugees in old barracks. Three emblematic characters guide us through a story that reveals, intimately, a collective history, an emblematic tale of all European countries today and their respective immigration policies and the changes occurring in the social fabric of European cities.

=505  00$aPepe is a Spanish immigrant who came to England more than forty years ago to work as a waiter. After working in several restaurants and hotels, he retired two years ago and now he fills his days with daily routines that keep him occupied. This film offers an insight into the daily life of a retired person in London. As the spectator discovers, behind the repetitive routines that fill up his days lies a rich personal story. The film is a visual exploration of the spaces where the character moves, his memories and desires.

=505  00$aQ2P is a film about toilets and the city. It sifts through the dream of Mumbai as a future Shanghai and searches for public toilets, watching who has to queue to pee. As the film observes who has access to toilets and who doesn't, we begin to also see the imagination of gender that underlies the city's shape, the constantly shifting boundaries between public and private space; we learn of small acts of survival that people in the city's bottom half cobble together and quixotic ideas of social change that thrive with mixed results; we hear the silence that surrounds toilets and sense how similar it is to the silence that surrounds inequality. The toilet becomes a riddle with many answers and some of those answers are questions - about gender, about class, about caste and most of all about space, urban development and the twisted myth of the global metropolis.

=505  00$aThis film explores the nature of friendship in Jamnagar, a town in Gujarat state, western India, through the eyes and impressions of Raju, an unmarried Jain man. These friendships are with school friends, a woman he loves and the film-maker himself. Throughout the film we follow Raju as he shows us his shop, his town, his home and other places that are important to him. From the outset the friendship between Raju and the film-maker is clear and at intervals throughout the film the film-maker reveals himself through commentary, discussing their relationship and speculating on Raju's reactions to events in his life. Raju and his father are traders and the film-maker observes and interviews them in their shop, learning their views on religion, business and the affection they feel for Jamnagar, which they consider to be peaceful. Ironically, this particular conversation is swamped by the continual noise of the street and traffic, but it is clear from their comments here and elsewhere that this peace is not solely an aural quality. The sensitive camera work (by Andy Jillings) helps communicate this affection. Later, Raju discusses relations between Hindus and Muslims in the town, pointing out areas where they live together, but noting that marriage rarely occurs. Raju then reveals that he and a Muslim woman (a Bohra in fact, see Roy 1984) had fallen in love but that, in the face of parental opposition, they decided that duty to their families was more important than their own happiness. The woman is now married to another man and does not appear in the film: Raju tells us that the friendship, treated with great propriety, still remains, however. In echoes of what might have been, Raju then takes the film-maker to a relative's wedding and then on to his ancestral village to worship at the family shrine-an act always performed by a newly-married man and his bride. They then return to Raju's home in the town where we see the easy relationship he has with his immediate family, including his brother's children. The second half of the film focuses more on relationships with friends: we meet an old school friend with whom Raju takes tea and discusses the finger signals they use to order it; afterwards we see him with a group of Muslim teachers with whom he once worked. In the film's final sequence Raju, two friends and the film-maker take a trip into the countryside and while relaxing there, Raju makes his final comments on the nature of friendship. It is partly duty, he says, but as he explores the idea of duty, he decides that the commitment of friendship is more of a pleasure than a duty. Thus it has been a pleasure for him to collaborate in the making of the film, not a duty.

Fleeing from white people, their diseases, massacres, and forest clearance, they tried to preserve their identity and their way of life.Here, painting one's skin red is a way of maintaining a link with a very ancient civilization. The Wajapi have a long history of using vegetable dyes to adorn their bodies with geometric motifs and symbols, the jenipa kusiwara. Over the centuries, they have developed a unique communication system - a rich blend of graphic and verbal components - that reflects their world-view and enables them to hand down knowledge about community life.

=505  00$aThe film recounts the life of children living on the street in Gondar, Ethiopia, by witnessing the interactionbetween two children and myself. The entire film was shot in the room of Ethiopia Hotel. This limited space allows the film to focus on our communication and captures some of the ideas that enable them to endure and survive on the street. Indeed, this film is more a sensitive testimony than a scientific documentary. This hybrid approach aims to explore new trends in visual anthropology, including the issue of dealing with intimacy and subjectivity.

=520  3\$aThe Feast of St John the Baptist begins two or three weeks after Corpus Christi, on June 23rd. According to biblical tradition, St John lived in the desert, renouncing the pleasures of this world. But the people of Cuyagua think of him as a flamboyantly dressed young man, with a passion for making merry.Although men provide drum music and join in the dancing, the celebration of St John's Feast is a predominantly female affair in Cuyagua, based on a large body of women's songs. The Saint with Two Faces introduces some of the leading women followers of St John, both at work cleaning the beach for tourists, and at home with their children. A group of these women describe their beliefs about St John and the way in which they organise his Feast. But these preliminary scenes also serve to establish the themes that will underlie the Feast itself - an extraordinary conjunction of the sacred and the profane, of celebration and mourning.

In 1883, a young German scientist - Franz Boas - arrived in the Canadian Arctic to map the coastline and indulge in his new interest the study of other cultures. As he charted Baffin Island, he recorded the lives and ideas of the Eskimo who helped him with his work. He became so absorbed by the common features that unite humans everywhere that he made the study of culture his life's work and did fieldwork in both the Arctic and the North West Coast of America among Indian tribes. Considered to be the founding father of American anthropology, Boas taught at Columbia University, encouraging his students to follow his example by actually working in the field.

=505  00$aA film about mobility, human creativity, and technology in a Sudanese truck community. The English Bedford-Lorry was introduced to Sudan in the late 1960s. Since then, local craftsmen technically modify the truck into an ideal vehicle, adequate for traveling off-road and for performing customers' expectations. The craftsmen and drivers call the lorry "Sifinja" because it is soft and comfortable like the plastic slippers it is named after. In different places in Sudan the carpenters and blacksmiths not only create a shiny iron bride, but they change the whole structure of the lorry through a highly unorthodox performance. Following closely the daily work, art and history of truck-modding on the Nile, a fascinating way of African creativity dealing with global commodities - the automobiles - is opened up. The documentary weaves the original sound of hammering and sawing, drilling and riveting, into a rhythmic, exhilarating audio-visual adventure.

This series gives a picture of everyday life, during the four seasons the film crew lived with the main characters, consisting of three generations of members of the Archemku family.The first part, Hundreds of Homes, relates the story of Sasha Archemku and his family. He is the leader of Sovchos Brigade No. 6 which actually consists of his closest family members and some temporary helpers. They move throughout the taiga with their herd of reindeer in the traditional Evenki way. Each year the family sets up "home" in more than ten different campsites.

He is joined by Kabuli master-musician, Ustad Asif Mahmoud, who plans to open a small private music school to teach traditional tabla drumming to young Afghans. However, Fremont is also a centre of musical innovation, with electronic keyboards and their built-in drum machines. In a series of in context performances we witness the co-existence of traditional and modern Afghan music and the dancing that goes with them both.

=505  00$aThe film illustrates the changes the Lepcha of the Dzongu reserve, North Sikkim, have been through in the last 60 years. From the 1940s, the Lepcha of Tingvong village gradually abandoned hunting, gathering and the slash and burn cultivation of dry rice, and became settled agriculturalists. Entire mountains sides were converted to cardamom and terraced for the cultivation of irrigated paddy. The irrigated rice and the cardamom cash crop not only brought the Lepcha within Sikkim's market economy but helped create a surplus which could among other things be invested in religion. In the 1940s, the Lepcha of Tingvong embraced Buddhism and all its complex rituals without however abandoning their strong shamanic traditions. Today, both forms of rituals amiably co-exist in the village. This film is part of a long-term visual anthropology training project for the tribal communities of Sikkim. The first phase aims to document the social life and rituals of the Lepcha of Dzongu. We have accumulated over 100 hours of material which is archived at the institute for research use. This is the first film edited from the material.

=520  3\$aUncanny Strangers is a 46 min non-fiction film shot in a fishing village in South Western Madagascar. The film follows different relations between the villagers and various human and non-human strangers - ancestor and tromba spirits, Western NGO workers, ecotourists, fish collectors, cattle rustlers and the ethnographic filmmaker. Through a series of everyday life episodes, it provides insights into the ontology of these relationships and the strategies employed by the villagers to make them work for their economic and political purposes. Through its specific ethnographic focus on the 'uncanny' qualities of such relations, the film points towards more generic issues related to hospitality practice, the constitution of selves through webs of relationships with others, and forms of collaboration in emerging transnational social field such as - here - environmental action.

They get sent to Panipat, a sleepy town and the only place in the world that wants them, recycling them back into yarn.Reshma is a bright, inquisitive woman working in a textile recycling factory in small time India, who dreams of travelling the vast distances the clothes she handles have. While Reshma shows us how these garments get transformed, she and other women workers reflect on these clothes. Despite limited exposure to western culture, they construct a picture of how the West is, using both their imagination and the rumours that travel with the cast-offs.

He was a master of the Afghan rubab, a double-chambered plucked lute with sympathetic strings. Using the observational cinema style the film shows Ustad Rahim in various contexts. These include a guided tour of the photos in his music room that recount his musical career, being at home with his wife and children, showing off his pigeons, erecting the tombstone for his father's grave, and teaching and playing the rubab. Of particular interest is the gormani ritual, a gathering of musicians where Rahim accepts a new student.

Their originality consists in using the 'invisible theatre' method in order to surprise the public and thus make it react itself to its own problems. This documentary shows how a local theatre company efficiently uses fiction to problematise today's African reality. This film presents two performances, one criticises the current proliferation of religious sects, the other deals with the awakening of villagers towards AIDS. Ymako, in Bambara, means 'our concerns'.
