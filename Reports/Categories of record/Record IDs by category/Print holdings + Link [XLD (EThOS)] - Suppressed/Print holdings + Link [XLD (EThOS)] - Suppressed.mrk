=520  3\$aBreast cancer is the world's most prevalent cancer. Although several drugs and chemotherapeutic strategies have been developed to tackle breast cancer, to date most patients eventually acquire resistance to these anticancer therapies. Therefore, identifying ways to increase the efficiency of currently used chemotherapeutic drugs and the development of new drugs for breast cancer treatment is essential. One way to achieve this goal is by identifying cellular targets which play a pivotal role in tumourigenesis and tumour progression. Paclitaxel belongs to a class of naturally occurring anti microtubule agents used for the treatment of malignancies such as breast cancer. Previous work has shown that FoxO3a, a transcription factor downstream of the phosphotidylinsitol-3-kinase/Akt signalling pathway, mediates apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in breast cancer cells in response to paclitaxel treatment. In order to elucidate the significance of FoxO expression and activation in response to paclitaxel treatment and oxidative stress (which is caused by paclitaxel treatment), I investigated the regulation of FoxO in endometrial and breast cancer cells. Both paclitaxel and oxidative stress were found to upregulate FoxO expression at the protein, mRNA and gene-promoter levels. Moreover, treatment with paclitaxel and hydrogen peroxide were shown to increase FoxO3a protein stability. Paclitaxel treatment resulted in JNK mediated nuclear accumulation of FoxO3a with a corresponding reduction in Akt activity. JNK was also shown to induce FoxO3a gene-promoter activity and to phosphorylate FoxO3a at two sites. These phosphorylation events may be important in the regulation of FoxO3a stability and activity. I also investigated the function of FoxO3a, by studying the role of BTG1, a downstream target of FoxO3a. I found that BTG1 expression was induced at the gene-promoter level by FoxO3a in MCF-7 cells. The use of a BTG1 inducible MCF-7 cell line revealed that over-expression of BTG1 results in changes in the expression levels of cell cycle regulators, reduction in cell growth and accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Taken together, these results show that FoxO expression and activity are upregulated following paclitaxel treatment and demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt/FoxO and JNK signalling pathways cross-talk at least at two levels. Furthermore, these results indicate that FoxO expression levels may serve as bio-marker for determining the effectiveness of paclitaxel treatment of breast cancer patients and that FoxOs may serve as a potential target for anti-cancer chemotherapeutic intervention.

=520  3\$aThis thesis centres on the development of multidimensional fluorescence imaging tools, with a particular emphasis on fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) microscopy for application to biological research. The key aspects of this thesis are the development and application of tunable supercontinuum excitation sources based on supercontinuum generation in microstructured optical fibres and the development of stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscope capable of fluorescence lifetime imaging beyond the diffraction limit. The utility of FLIM for biological research is illustrated by examples of experimental studies of the molecular structure of sarcomeres in muscle fibres and of signalling at the immune synapse. The application of microstructured optical fibre to provide tunable supercontinuum excitation source for a range of FLIM microscopes is presented, including wide-field, Nipkow disk confocal and hyper-spectral line scanning FLIM microscopes. For the latter, a detailed description is provided of the supercontinuum source and semi-confocal line-scanning microscope configuration that realised multidimensional fluorescence imaging, resolving fluorescence images with respect to excitation and emission wavelength, fluorescence lifetime and three spatial dimensions. This included the first biological application of a fibre laser-pumped supercontinuum exploiting a tapered microstructured optical fibre that was able to generate a spectrally broad output extending to ~ 350 nm in the ultraviolet. The application of supercontinuum generation to the first super-resolved FLIM microscope is then described. This novel microscope exploited the concept of STED with a femtosecond mode-locked Ti:Sapphire laser providing a tunable excitation beam by pumping microstructured optical fibre for supercontinuum generation and directly providing the (longer wavelength) STED beam. This STED microscope was implemented in a commercial scanning confocal microscope to provide compatibility with standard biological imaging, and exploited digital holography using a spatial light modulator (SLM) to provide the appropriate phase manipulation for shaping the STED beam profile and to compensate for aberrations. The STED microscope was shown to be capable of recording super resolution in both the lateral and axial planes, according to the settings of the SLM.

=520  3\$aNuclear receptors (NR) are ligand-induced transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes involved in a number of physiological processes including metabolism. Their ability to regulate transcription is dependent on the recruitment of specific cofactors that remodel chromatin and promote the assembly of the basal transcriptional machinery. Receptor interacting protein 140 (RIP140) is a corepressor for NRs that utilizes four independent repression domains to inhibit gene expression of target genes. While RIP140-null mice develop around 70% less white adipose tissue than wild-type littermates, the process of adipogenesis is unaffected in RIP140-null and RIP140-expressing cells. To elucidate the intrinsic role of RIP140 in adipocytes I used full mouse genome arrays to compare the gene expression profiles of pre-adipocytes and adipocytes with and without RIP140. I demonstrate that the transcriptional corepressor negatively regulates major gene clusters in a number of metabolic pathways including glycolysis, TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid oxidation and glycerol metabolism. Additionally, a futile metabolic cycle of triglyceride recycling is activated in RIP140 null adipocytes. In order to determine the molecular mechanism of RIP140 repression I analysed the epigenetic profile of Ucp1, a gene which is typically expressed in brown but not white adipocytes. I utilized RIP140-null and RIP140-expressing adipocytes and found that RIP140 is essential for both DNA and histone methylation to maintain gene repression. RIP140 expression promotes the assembly of DNA and histone methyltransferases on the Ucp1 enhancer and leads to methylation of specific CpG residues and histones as judged by bisulphite genomic sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. These results suggest that RIP140 serves as a scaffold for both DNA and histone methyltransferase activities to inhibit gene transcription by two key epigenetic repression systems. RIP140 could potentially act to divert white adipocytes from a brown fat phenotype by repressing genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial respiration and by silencing genes like Ucp1.

=520  3\$aThe worldwide demand for more diverse and greener energy supply has had a significant impact on the development of wind energy in the last decades. From 2 GW in 1990, the global installed capacity has now reached about 100 GW and is estimated to grow to 1000 GW by 2025. As wind power penetration increases, it is important to investigate its effect on the power system. Among the various technologies available for wind energy conversion, the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) is one of the preferred solutions because it offers the advantages of reduced mechanical stress and optimised power capture thanks to variable speed operation. This work presents the small-signal modelling and analysis of the DFIG for power system stability studies. This thesis starts by reviewing the mathematical models of wind turbines with DFIG convenient for power system studies. Different approaches proposed in the literature for the modelling of the turbine, drive-train, generator, rotor converter and external power system are discussed. It is shown that the flexibility of the drive train should be represented by a two-mass model in the presence of a gearbox. In the analysis part, the steady-state behaviour of the DFIG is examined. Comparison is made with the conventional synchronous generators (SG) and squirrel-cage induction generators to highlight the differences between the machines. The initialisation of the DFIG dynamic variables and other operating quantities is then discussed. Various methods are briefly reviewed and a step-by-step procedure is suggested to avoid the iterative computations in initial condition mentioned in the literature. The dynamical behaviour of the DFIG is studied with eigenvalue analysis. Modal analysis is performed for both open-loop and closed-loop situations. The effect of parameters and operating point variations on small signal stability is observed. For the open-loop DFIG, conditions on machine parameters are obtained to ensure stability of the system. For the closed-loop DFIG, it is shown that the generator electrical transients may be neglected once the converter controls are properly tuned. A tuning procedure is proposed and conditions on proportional gains are obtained for stable electrical dynamics. Finally, small-signal analysis of a multi-machine system with both SG and DFIG is performed. It is shown that there is no common mode to the two types of generators. The result confirms that the DFIG does not introduce negative damping to the system, however it is also shown that the overall effect of the DFIG on the power system stability depends on several structural factors and a general statement as to whether it improves or detriorates the oscillatory stability of a system can not be made.

The total synthesis of lactonamycin (1), a natural product isolated from a soil sample, by Matsomoto and co-workers1 is currently under investigation. Lactonamycin (1) possesses antimicrobal activity against Gram-Positive bacteria including MRSA and VRE as well as appreciable levels of cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines. A highly oxygenated fused perhydrofuran-furanone structural motif and a naphtha[e]isoindole ring system make up the hexacylcic core of lactonamycin (1). Adding to the structural complexity, a 2,3,6-trideoxy sugar unit is connected to the core structure via a highly hindered tertiary glycosidic linkage. Various strategies for glycosidation, using the known ABCD alcohol (Ã,Â±)-2 as a model for the tertiary alcohol of lactonamycin (1) are discussed. Of these include, the use of classical glycosidation approaches and more novel strategies that employ open chain glycosyl donors. In particular, the synthesis of glycoside 4 and subsequent investigations towards target compound 5 are described.

=520  3\$aThe measured photocurrent of a solar cell may be considered the sum of a photogenerated current due solely to the influx of photons, and a photovoltage-induced current due to carrier injection at the electrodes. Correcting the measured photocurrent for the injected current yields the voltage dependence of the photogenerated current alone. This corrected photocurrent can provide valuable insight into the processes governing the behaviour of a solar cell, yet is seldom measured or discussed within the community. In this dissertation, an original experimental technique designed specifically for the reliable measurement of the corrected photocurrent is described, with the intent of applying it to organic bulk-heterojunction solar cells. Solar cells based on a number of donor-acceptor combinations were investigated. Using the experimental technique developed here, corrected photocurrent-voltage characteristics exhibiting remarkably anti-symmetric profiles were obtained and subsequently rationalised with a simple physical model. From the perspective of this model, the nature of charge extraction at the electrodes - and how this is affected by processes such as thermal annealing - was examined. Finally, a new low band-gap, small-molecule acceptor material was used in bulk-heterojunction solar cells, and shown to promising photovoltaic performance. Interestingly, these devices exhibited anomalous current-voltage characteristics, which, on closer examination, could be explained by an electric field dependence in the photogeneration rate. Throughout this work, particular attention was given to how these findings may be used to improve device efficiencies.

=520  3\$aMagnetite (Fe3O4) is of both scientific and technological interest because of its fascinating magnetic properties. It has a high Curie temperature of 860 K and a theoretical 100% spin polarization at the Fermi level. There are a variety of deposition techniques to form thin films of magnetite, such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), pulsed laser deposition (PLD), iron oxidation, sputtering and so on. In comparison with other deposition methods mentioned above, electrodeposition has a key advantage of relatively low processing temperature. The intention of this work was to investigate magnetite (Fe3O4) thin films grown via an electrochemical route by using various kinds of characterization techniques, especially on morphology, chemical composition, structure and magnetic properties. Fe3O4 thin films were obtained by using a galvanostatic or potentiostatic deposition from simple aqueous solutions of ferrous salts. Iron oxide thin films have been grown at different current densities and temperatures onto polycrystalline copper substrates. XRD results indicate that Fe3O4 is formed at 90 oC at an applied current density of 0.05 mAÂ·cm-2. Lower growth temperatures can cause the formation of another phase, a-FeOOH at a certain concentration of Fe2+ and pH buffer. Time-dependent growth of the iron oxides exhibits nucleation and coalescence. In order to obtain uniform Fe3O4 film surface, longer deposition times are needed. The influence of applied potential on the characteristics of the deposited iron oxide was examined. The formation of Fe3O4 in a low potential regime (< 100 mV) vs. gold reference electrode while iron oxyhydroxides such as goethite (a-FeOOH) and lepidocrocite (?-FeOOH) are favoured for E > 100 mV. The magnetic properties of the films were found to be strongly dependent on the deposition potential. The multi-layer structure of Fe3O4/a-FeOOH/Fe3O4 onto NiO/Ni substrates has been demonstrated via successive deposition. A TEM cross-section image shows a-FeOOH is coherently formed between two ferromagnetic layers. ADF-STEM micrographs show that Fe3O4 has a columnar structure and has less composition variation compared to that grown onto a polycrystalline copper substrate. Synchrotron techniques, i.e. x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), were performed to examine the iron oxide film. Fe K-edge x-ray absorption spectra demonstrate that the films grown at low potential regime (< 100 mV) have a comparable valency state with the standard Fe3O4 sample. The identification of the iron oxide was further confirmed by using XMCD technique. The calculation of the asymmetry ratio suggests that the total magnetic moment increased with decreasing applied potential. In addition, vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) data show that the magnetic response is somewhat slower for the iron oxide grown at higher potential regime. A change of pH in the electrolyte does not change the lattice constant and film morphology or texture but does affect particle sizes in Fe3O4 thin films. This decrease with the pH is due to the reaction of FeOH+ ions with molecular oxygen in electrolyte.

=520  3\$aSustainable treatment and disposal of mine waste is a serious environmental issue faced by the mining industry worldwide. Conventional methods of mine waste management predominantly involve indefinite retention in engineered tailings dams. The cost and liability of such surface storage facilities have increased significantly in recent years as an outcome of stringent environmental legislation and mine closure requirements gradually transforming the economics of mine waste disposal. Backfill methods, particularly cemented paste backfill, are increasingly perceived as sustainable, environmentally friendly and cost-effective alternatives as they put waste material to practical use. Controlled low-strength materials (CLSM) offer an effective and practical alternative to similar analogues - requiring minimal compaction, being self-levelling and excavatable in the future if necessary. The aim of this research was to develop and evaluate CLSM, previously un-tested at mines, in which novel utilisation of bioleach waste is maximised and Portland cement content minimised while satisfying performance requirements for classification as CLSM. Leachability of toxic substances was minimised through encapsulating CLSM within a coating of relatively inert CLSM. Formulation and optimisation of CLSM using statistical mixture design and response surface analysis has ensured proper understanding of component interactions and influence on mechanical strength with a minimum amount of experiments. Optimised CLSM formulations were tested for their mechanical, physical, micro-structural, mineralogical and chemical properties. Effects of encapsulation were determined by assessing chemical leaching. The work indicated that bioleach waste could be beneficially reformed as CLSM of appropriate compressive strength for application in groundwork as loadbearing materials. Porosity and hydraulic conductivity were correspondingly high. Leachability of arsenic, barium, chromium, lead and zinc was significant (levels varied depending on waste type). Encapsulation significantly reduced leachability indicating promising potential for implementation of this technology in the mining industry. The research presented in this thesis substantiated the need for, and potential of, sustainable novel alternative technologies such as CLSM to augment future waste management strategies in the mining industry via safe emplacement of solid bioleach waste in the sub-surface.

=520  3\$aPredicting N release in agricultural soils amended with organic residuals is essential to ensure there are sufficient nutrients for crops, and minimal losses to the environment. Factors such as moisture, temperature, soil type and organic residuals type may affect the amount of mineralised nutrients. Information is required to describe microbial N immobilisation in biosolids-amended soil, which may vary between soil types influencing extent and rate of nutrient release. Industrial biowastes are increasingly being used as soil amendments as a diversion from landfill disposal; these materials result from a diverse range of processes and vary greatly in physical and chemical characteristics. There is little published or advisory information regarding their agronomic benefit, therefore research is required to quantify their fertiliser value. The aims of this research were to quantify mineralisation of N, and investigate other agronomic benefits of biosolids and biowastes, and to investigate microbial biomass N (MBN) dynamics, with the aim of improving fertiliser guidelines. A field trial was established at the Imperial College field station in Wye, Kent, in spring 2005, to investigate N transformations in contrasting soil types amended with conventional and enhanced treated biosolids. Analysis of MBN in biosolids-amended soil indicated that there were differences in N immobilisation processes in soils of differing fertility status, with greater immobilisation observed in the lower fertility soil in some cases. Despite initial differences in rate of mineralisation and nitrification, overall extent of N release was similar in both soils. A programme of field trials was established at Imperial College Silwood Park campus in 2006-2007 to quantify the agronomic value of a range of industrial biowastes. Biowastes from the vegetable, meat and dairy industries and from aerobic and anaerobic digestion plants were investigated. Yield response and N offtake of perennial ryegrass to biowastes, at five rates of application, in comparison to mineral N fertiliser, was used to calculate the replacement N fertiliser value. The results of a laboratory incubation experiment, to investigate MBN and mineral N in biowastes-amended soil, demonstrated lower recoveries of N in fine textured soil with low stability waste. Denitrification was suspected as the potential mechanism for this observation. Interactions between soil type and biowaste type on N availability, and the implications for gaseous N losses to the environment from biowastes-amended soils require further research.

=520  3\$aFoot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes a highly infectious disease of cloven-hoofed livestock with economically devastating consequences. The political and technical problems associated with the use of FMDV vaccines make drug-based disease control an attractive alternative. The FMDV genome is translated as a single polypeptide precursor that is cleaved into functional proteins by virally-encoded proteases. Ten of the thirteen cleavages are performed by the highly conserved 3C protease (3Cpro), making this enzyme an attractive target for anti-viral drugs (Curry et al., 2007a). This thesis describes the design, synthesis and evaluation of FMDV 3Cpro inhibitors. A study of the activity of different FMDV 3Cpro mutants and a recently determined enzyme-substrate crystal structure provide an insight to the structure-activity relationships of the target and provides a basis for the inhibitor design (Curry et al., 2007b; Sweeney et al., 2007). Taking the enzyme's specificity as a starting point (Birtley et al., 2005), a small peptide sequence corresponding to an optimal substrate has been modified at the C-terminus, by the addition of a warhead, making it able to irreversibly react with the active site of this cysteine protease. Several synthetic routes have been developed, one allowed easy modification of the peptidic component of the inhibitor, whereas a second was designed to enable the introduction of variation on the warhead moiety. After the expression and purification of the FMDV 3Cpro, a FRET assay, developed to monitor changes on 3Cpro activity (Jaulent et al., 2007), was used to evaluate the inhibition of the enzyme by a range of potential synthetic inhibitors. The success of the inhibitor design has been demonstrated by the development of compounds that react as Michael acceptors with the enzyme active site. The investigation of the peptidic part of the inhibitor has highlighted key elements for inhibition which are supported by structural data. Finally, consideration of the bioavailability of these inhibitors, particularly in regard to membrane penetration, has led to use pro-drug approach in the further development of the inhibitors.

=520  3\$aThe aims of this work were to develop techniques for describing morphological variations of shoulder bones and to test these on real datasets. The robust measurement and description of anatomical geometry can provide accurate estimation and better understanding of bone morphology. Feature lines were detected automatically using crest line techniques and shape information from shoulder bones was extracted based on the extracted feature lines. Redefinition of local coordinate systems was proposed utilising the crest line technique. Three dimensional statistical shape models (SSM) were built for a set of primate humeri and scapulae. Two types of models were constructed; one incorporated the maintained original scale whilst the other used scaled bones. Variations were captured and quantified by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The application can be extended generally to long bones and other complex bones and was also tested on human femora. Techniques to predict the shape of one bone from its neighbour at a joint were presented. PCA was used to reduce data dimensionality to a few principal components. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Partial Least Square (PLS) Regression were applied to explore the linear morphological correlations between the two shoulder bones and to predict the shape of one segment given the shape of the adjoining segment.

=520  3\$aPartial specifications allow approximate models of systems such as Kripke structures, or labeled transition systems to be created. Using the abstraction possible with these models, an avoidance of the state-space explosion problem is possible, whilst still retaining a structure that can have properties checked over it. A single partial specification abstracts a set of systems, whether Kripke, labeled transition systems, or systems with both atomic propositions and named transitions. This thesis deals in part with problems arising from a desire to efficiently evaluate sentences of the modal Ã,Âµ-calculus over a partial specification. Partial specifications also allow a single system to be modeled by a number of partial specifications, which abstract away different parts of the system. Alternatively, a number of partial specifications may represent different requirements on a system. The thesis also addresses the question of whether a set of partial specifications is consistent, that is to say, whether a single system exists that is abstracted by each member of the set. The effect of nominals, special atomic propositions true on only one state in a system, is also considered on the problem of the consistency of many partial specifications. The thesis also addresses the question of whether the systems a partial specification abstracts are all abstracted by a second partial specification, the problem of inclusion. The thesis demonstrates how commonly used Ã,?specification patternsÃ,? Ã,? useful properties specified in the modal Ã,Âµ-calculus, can be efficiently evaluated over partial specifications, and gives upper and lower complexity bounds on the problems related to sets of partial specifications.

=520  3\$aHydrothermal systems have been suggested as suitable environments for the appearance of life on the Early Earth and may provide habitats for microorganisms on Mars. The deposits created by these systems are preserved in the geological record. This research investigates the key mineralogical, textural and biological markers found in terrestrial hydrothermal deposits that can be used as analogues in the search for evidence of life on Mars. Samples of silica sinter from Iceland and New Zealand, the Rhynie Chert 396 Ma old deposit from Aberdeenshire and hydrothermally altered impactites from the Chicxulub impact crater have been analysed to understand the mineralogical properties unique to the different hydrothermal conditions and the evidence of extant or extinct microorganisms within them. Re-colonisation of basaltic substrates by hot spring-derived cultures was also carried out. This research was conducted using a multidisciplinary approach with the analytical techniques and instruments involved currently used for in-situ and orbital observations of planetary bodies. The principal techniques, Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GCMS), were used due to their combined capabilities in the identification of a variety of rocks and minerals, and a wide range of organic compounds. This PhD research has shown that FTIR in particular is an exceptional analytical technique for use in astrobiological investigations. This research has characterised hydrothermal deposits of different ages and created by different processes on Earth to ascertain their potential for preserving organic compounds in similar deposits on Mars. Results indicate that siliceous hydrothermal deposits of recent and ancient formation yield biomolecular evidence for past and present microbial colonisation as do hydrothermally altered impact deposits and re-colonised basaltic substrates. The identification of mineralogical and biological information using FTIR reflectance spectroscopy has wide implications in the search for life on Mars and other planetary bodies.

=520  3\$aThe present work sets out to investigate the stylistic profiles of two modern Chinese versions of CervantesÃ,?s Don Quijote (I): by Yang Jiang (1978), the first direct translation from Castilian to Chinese, and by Liu Jingsheng (1995), which is one of the most commercially successful versions of the Castilian literary classic. This thesis focuses on a detailed linguistic analysis carried out with the help of the latest textual analytical tools, natural language processing applications and statistical packages. The type of linguistic phenomenon singled out for study is four-character expressions (FCEXs), which are a very typical category of Chinese phraseology. The work opens with the creation of a descriptive framework for the annotation of linguistic data extracted from the parallel corpus of Don Quijote. Subsequently, the classified and extracted data are put through several statistical tests. The results of these tests prove to be very revealing regarding the different use of FCEXs in the two Chinese translations. The computational modelling of the linguistic data would seem to indicate that among other findings, while LiuÃ,?s use of archaic idioms has followed the general patterns of the original and also of YangÃ,?s work in the first half of Don Quijote I, noticeable variations begin to emerge in the second half of LiuÃ,?s more recent version. Such an idiosyncratic use of archaisms by Liu, which may be defined as style shifting or style variation, is then analyzed in quantitative terms through the application of the proposed context-motivated theory (CMT). The results of applying the CMT-derived statistical models show that the detected stylistic variation may well point to the internal consistency of the translator in rendering the second half of Part I of the novel, which reflects his freer, more creative and experimental style of translation. Through the introduction and testing of quantitative research methods adapted from corpus linguistics and textual statistics, this thesis has made a major contribution to methodological innovation in the study of style within the context of corpus-based translation studies.

=520  3\$aThis thesis is about understanding the processes that explain the patterns of extinction risk and declines that we see in amphibians, how we can use that understanding to set conservation priorities, and how we can convert those priorities into practical, hands-on research and management. In particular, I focus on the threat posed by the emerging infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, which is caused by the chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). Amphibians display a non-random pattern of extinction risk, both taxonomically and geographically. In chapter two I investigate the mechanism behind the observed taxonomic selectivity and find that it is due to species biology rather than heterogeneity in either threat intensity or conservation knowledge. In chapter three I determine which biological and environmental traits are important in rendering a species susceptible to declines, focussing on susceptibility to Bd. I found that restricted range, high elevation species with an aquatic life-stage are more likely to have suffered a decline. Using these traits, I predict species and locations that may be susceptible in the future, and which should therefore be a high priority for amphibian research and conservation.

=520  3\$aMany animal populations are threatened by human activity, including habitat loss and harvesting but recent advances in population ecology show that the age- and sex-structure are important when aiming to understand population dynamics. However, research on population dynamics often focuses on species that experience relatively little human disturbance and human caused mortality is often assumed not to affect population dynamics. An increasing number of studies shows short-term and long-term evolutionary and ecological consequences of harvesting. This has not only implications for the understanding of population dynamics but also for the management and conservation of species in human-dominated landscapes. This thesis aims to investigate the interaction between the demographic structure and harvesting in a fluctuating species, the red grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus) using a combination of empirical and theoretical approaches. The relative roles of age-related parasite burden, fecundity and shooting in driving population dynamics are assessed, and empirical data are used to parameterise a model examining the effect of harvesting on the population dynamics. The empirical part of the thesis starts with the investigation of the intensity and distribution of the parasitic nematode Trichostrongylus tenuis for three age-classes of red grouse before the breeding season. The intensity of the parasite increased with host age. Parasites in two-year-old grouse were more aggregated than in one-year-old and 3+-year-old grouse. This has implications for population dynamics because the aggregation of parasites within the host influences mortality rates. Females of the oldest age class (3+-years-old) were less fecund than younger grouse and interactions with nesting habitat and year were found to affect female fecundity. The age- and sex-structure of shot birds was compared with the age- and sex-structure of the population before shooting. More old birds were shot at small bag sizes but this bias decreased as more birds were shot. Old males were highly susceptible to shooting at the beginning of the season but susceptibility decreased with number of shooting events. A relationship between bag numbers and population density was found. An age- and sex-structured population model was used to examine the effect of harvesting on red grouse population dynamics. Selective harvest for or against a certain age class led to a skew in the sex ratio of the population and to a decrease in fecundity and therefore to a drop in population size and harvest yield. Parasites and the exclusion of young birds through aggressiveness affected the population dynamics and led to a skew in the harvest rate at which the maximum sustainable yield was attained. Shooting early in the season resulted in a higher yield because individuals were removed from the population before they contributed to the availability of free ranging stages of the parasite. The population model demonstrated that parasites, aggressiveness and harvesting interact and that harvesting is a significant factor in population dynamics. Overall, the current practice of shooting rarely more than 50% of the population seems to be a good precautionary principle. Uncertainty in the harvesting rate increased the probability of local extirpation of the population. Therefore, reliable estimates of the population, including the age and sex structure, are invaluable parts of red grouse management. This study showed that harvesting and the age and sex structure of the population are important drivers of red grouse population dynamics and an understanding of their interactions is important for sustainable management of red grouse.

=520  3\$aThis thesis presents the development and application of a numerical inverse and forward model of stratigraphy applied to shallow-marine wave-dominated sedimentary systems. The approach links a 'process-based' forward model of stratigraphy (i.e. BARSIM, developed by J.E.A. Storms, University of Delft) to a fully non-linear stochastic inverse scheme. The inverse problem has been formulated using a Bayesian framework in order to sample the full range of uncertainty and explicitly build in prior knowledge. The methodology combines Reversible Jump Markov chain Monte Carlo and Simulated Tempering algorithms which are able to deal with variable dimensional inverse problems and multi-modal posterior probability distributions, respectively. The numerical scheme requires the construction of a likelihood function to quantify the agreement between simulated and observed data (e.g. sediment ages and thicknesses, grain-size distributions). Prior to real case study applications, the method has been successfully validated on different scenarios built from synthetic data, in which the impact of data distribution, quantity and quality on the uncertainty of the inferred environmental parameters were investigated. The numerical scheme has then been applied to two case studies: the outcrop-constrained Lower Cretaceous 'Standardville' parasequence of the Aberdeen Member of the Blackhawk Formation (Boock Cliffs, Utah, U.S.A.) and the Emsian sub-surface data of South Algeria. The inverse modelling scheme successfully reproduced stratigraphic architecture in both cases, within the constraints of the input data quality. The inferences of the relative sea level, sediment supply and wave regime histories contribute to the understanding of mechanisms that produced the observed stratigraphy. Of equal importance, the inverse results allowed complete characterisation of uncertainties in these forcing parameters and in the stratigraphic architecture developed in between data constraints. These results suggest that the inverse model may ultimately provide a process-based geological complement to standard geostatistical tools for the static characterization of hydrocarbon reservoirs.

=520  3\$aSince its initial publication the SABR model has gained widespread use across asset classes and it has now become the standard pricing framework used in the market to quote interest rate products sensitive to the non flat strike-structure of the market implied volatility. While very simple, the modelÂ's use has always been based on the original study of its authors who derive a formula for pricing European options through a few approximating assumptions which are at times severely violated in the market. This thesisÂ' main theoretical goal is to set the path for a generalization of the SABR model which possesses a closed form solution free from assumptions about the magnitude of the modelÂ's parameters. We propose such model and derive a closed form solution for the particular case in which the underlying forward rate and its volatility are uncorrelated. After using the solution for pricing caplets within a LIBOR Market Model framework we simplify an approximation for the swap rate developed by Piterbarg in order to use the same solution for the pricing of swaptions. We conduct the modelÂ's calibration for short maturities using a computationally efficient approach which derives an approximation for the modelÂ's implied volatility and uses it to fit the model to market quotes. Finally, we study the properties of the greeks of our model in comparison with those of the classical Black model.

=520  3\$aDue to globalization and international trade, moving goods using a mixture of transportation modes has become a norm; today, large vessels transport 95% of the international cargos. In the first part of this thesis, the emphasis is on the sea-land intermodal transport. The availability of different modes of transportation (rail/road/direct) in sea-land intermodal transport and container flows (import, export, transhipment) through the terminal are considered simultaneously within a given planning time horizon. We have also formulated this problem as an Integer Programming (IP) model and the objective is to minimise storage cost, loading and transportation cost from/to the customers. To further understand the computational complexity and performance of the model, we have randomly generated a large number of test instances for extensive experimentation of the algorithm. Since, CPLEX was unable to find the optimal solution for the large test problems; a heuristic algorithm has been devised based on the original IP model to find near 'optimal' solutions with a relative error of less than 4%. Furthermore, we developed and implemented Lagrangian Relaxation (LR) of the IP formulation of the original problem. The bounds derived from LR were improved using sub-gradient optimisation and computational results are presented. In the second part of the thesis, we consider the combined problems of container assignment and yard crane (YC) deployment within the container terminal. A new IP formulation has been developed using a unified approach with the view to determining optimal container flows and YC requirements within a given planning time horizon. We designed a Branch and Cut (B&C) algorithm to solve the problem to optimality which was computationally evaluated. A novel heuristic approach based on the IP formulation was developed and implemented in C++. Detailed computational results are reported for both the exact and heuristic algorithms using a large number of randomly generated test problems. A practical application of the proposed model in the context of a real case-study is also presented. Finally, a simulation model of container terminal operations based on discrete-event simulation has been developed and implemented with the view of validating the above optimisation model and using it as a test bed for evaluating different operational scenarios.

=520  3\$aThe current thesis presents a numerical study of steady and unsteady turbulent reacting flows. The flow is calculated using Finite Volume based parabolic and elliptic flow solvers. A transported probability density function (pdf) approach, closed at the joint-scalar level,is used for the inclusion of the thermochemistry. A common characteristic of all the studied cases are the strong finite rate chemistry effects which govern the flow. Two experimentally well documented turbulent lifted flames were computed in order to explore the detailed thermochemical flow structure and to reduce uncertainties associated with the chemical kinetics. The effect of the applied detailed chemistry and its subsequent simplification on the calculated thermochemical structure was also quantified. The two cases feature fuel jets of methane or hydrogen issuing into a vitiated, high temperature coflow. Molecular mixing is closed using the modified Curl's mixing model and two algebraic closures are considered for the closure of the mixing frequency. More complex flow patterns are considered through the calculation of bluff body stabilised flames. These flames feature a recirculation region and a neck zone of high strain rates, where significant levels of local extinction are found. The transported pdf method captures the local extinction and can predict the pollutant formation with high accuracy. The standard mixing frequency closure leads to over-prediction of local extinction, while an algebraic extension leads to improved predictions. When the flame is close to global extinction, strong instabilities occur, which lead to questions regarding the use of a two-dimensional approach. For this reason, a three-dimensional computational tool was developed and validated using both presumed and transported pdf methods for the representation of the thermochemistry.

=520  3\$aAdherent CD34+ cells are a stem cell enriched population with a high frequency of primitive stem cells that are genetically primed to differentiate into tissue-specific lineages. These cells make up the adherent CD34+ cells in peripheral blood which are the focus of this study. The first aim of this study was to transcriptionally characterize adherent CD34+ cells relative to nonadherent CD34+ cells using a whole human genome Affymetrix U133 plus 2 array. The subsequent analysis demonstrated transcriptional differences in genes which are involved in quiescence, cell cycle, homing and adhesion, which are likely to be relevant to the suitability of adherent CD34+ cells for clinical application. To verify the microarray analysis, a selection of representative transcripts was chosen and their relative expression was compared using real-time qPCR. To analyze further the stem cell characteristics of adherent CD34+ cells, the DNA replication timing kinetics of pluripotency-associated genes in bone marrow-derived adherent CD34+ cells, non-adherent CD34+ cells, and foetal mesenchymal stem cells were conducted and compared to those of embryonic stem (ES) cells. This showed that pluripotency-associated genes Oct4 and Nanog replicate early in the cell cycle similar to ES cells. The second aim of this study was to examine the potential use of adherent CD34+ cells in neural injury. As adherent CD34+ cells are primitive stem cells, it was reasonable to hypothesize that these cells would differentiate into neural cells in vitro, but these experiments revealed that these cells are not neurogenic and, in our hands, do not differentiate into neural cells. The experiments revealed that adherent CD34+ cells differentiate efficiently and reproducibly into microglia-like cells (CD34MG cells). CD34MG cells upregulated microglia-associated antigens and demonstrated functional characteristics of microglia cells including TNF and IL-6 release in response to lipopolysaccharide. CD34MG also stimulate responders in a mixed lymphocyte reaction, suggesting antigen presenting capabilities. To determine if these cells might be exploited for use in brain tumour therapy, it was shown that CD34MG migrate and invade in response to brain tumour glioma cells. Results also suggest that these cells are capable of presenting glioma specific antigen to immune cells in an autologous lymphocyte reaction in vitro. The combined results suggest that CD34MG cells might be exploited for therapeutic purposes in brain tumours. Stem cells are currently being explored for their therapeutic potential. This study demonstrates that adherent CD34+ cells and CD34MG cells may be useful for clinical use.

=520  3\$aLiver surgical resection is one of the most frequently used curative therapies. However, resectability is problematic. There is a need for a computer-assisted surgical planning and simulation system which can accurately and efficiently simulate the liver, vessels and tumours in actual patients. The present project describes the development of these core segmentation and deformable modelling techniques. For precise detection of irregularly shaped areas with indistinct boundaries, the segmentation incorporated active contours - gradient vector flow (GVF) snakes and level sets. To improve efficiency, a chessboard distance transform was used to replace part of the GVF effort. To automatically initialize the liver volume detection process, a rotating template was introduced to locate the starting slice. For shape maintenance during the segmentation process, a simplified object shape learning step was introduced to avoid occasional significant errors. Skeletonization with fuzzy connectedness was used for vessel segmentation. To achieve real-time interactivity, the deformation regime of this system was based on a single-organ mass-spring system (MSS), which introduced an on-the-fly local mesh refinement to raise the deformation accuracy and the mesh control quality. This method was now extended to a multiple soft-tissue constraint system, by supplementing it with an adaptive constraint mesh generation. A mesh quality measure was tailored based on a wide comparison of classic measures. Adjustable feature and parameter settings were thus provided, to make tissues of interest distinct from adjacent structures, keeping the mesh suitable for on-line topological transformation and deformation. More than 20 actual patient CT and 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) liver datasets were tested to evaluate the performance of the segmentation method. Instrument manipulations of probing, grasping, and simple cutting were successfully simulated on deformable constraint liver tissue models. This project was implemented in conjunction with the Division of Surgery, Hammersmith Hospital, London; the preliminary reality effect was judged satisfactory by the consultant hepatic surgeon.

=520  3\$aInterspecific competition is often proposed to shape mammalian evolution. Many studies use trait and distribution data on extant species, but this ignores temporal aspects of competition. Phylogeny provides a framework for integrating present-day data with clade histories. Here, I use phylogenetic comparative methods and present-day data to investigate the role of competition in the evolution of four mammalian clades: New World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae), New World monkeys (Platyrrhini), Australasian possums (Phalangeriformes), and ground squirrels (Marmotini). I ask four specific questions: (1) Do community phylogenies, and/or the traits of community members, show patterns expected under competition? (2) Is there evidence of competition in the relationship among species' trait differences, phylogenetic differences and patterns of coexistence? (3) Does the intensity of competition affect rates of morphological evolution? (4) Are the tempo and/or mode of mammalian body size evolution influenced by competition? I found evidence for competition in monkeys and squirrels, but not bats or possums. Competition did not influence rates of morphological evolution; instead body mass was the most important correlate across the groups. Across all mammals, the best-supported model of body size evolution corresponded to a scenario in which mammals experienced a relatively early burst of morphological evolution, followed by a slowdown in rate as competition for niches increased. In addition, around 60% of the variation in the tempo of body-mass evolution was explained by just a few predictors. In conclusion, I find some support for competition shaping mammalian evolution. However, there is evidence that the importance of other processes may outweigh the effects of competition in some groups. Further study and methodological improvements are required to fully understand the relative role of competition in evolution. The methods developed in this thesis provide a useful starting point for such studies.

=520  3\$aThe possible existence of liquid water beneath the ice crusts of Ganymede and Europa makes these bodies of great scientific interest as the accessibility of the oceans has implications for astrobiology and future human exploration of the solar system. Study of the cratering trends on these bodies provides one means of assessing the depth of the ice layer above the sub-surface oceans. This work combines observational and numerical modelling data to develop a quantitative model for impact cratering in pure H₂O ice. Topographic profiles of craters on Ganymede are presented and used to construct scaling trends, which are then compared to similar trends for the Moon and Mars in order to assess differences in the cratering process in rock, ice and ice-rock mixes. The progression of central peak and central pit crater morphology as crater diameter increases, is used to develop a paradigm for central peak collapse and pit formation on Ganymede. These observed cratering trends are used to test the results of hydrocode simulation of impact cratering. These simulations were used to determine an appropriate material strength model, and its specific parameters, for the simulation of impact crater formation in un-layeredice. This optimal strength model is then applied to impact cratering in a layered ice and water target. The results from this numerical modelling are compared to the Europan cratering trends and used to estimate the thickness of Europa's ice crust.

=520  3\$aThe objective of this thesis is the development of automatic methods to measure the changes in volume and growth of brain structures in prematurely born infants. Automatic tools for accurate tissue quantification from magnetic resonance images can provide means for understanding how the neurodevelopmental effects of the premature birth, such as cognitive, neurological or behavioural impairment, are related to underlying changes in brain anatomy. Understanding these changes forms a basis for development of suitable treatments to improve the outcomes of premature birth. In this thesis we focus on the segmentation of brain structures from magnetic resonance images during early childhood. Most of the current brain segmentation techniques have been focused on the segmentation of adult or neonatal brains. As a result of rapid development, the brain anatomy during early childhood differs from anatomy of both adult and neonatal brains and therefore requires adaptations of available techniques to produce good results. To address the issue of anatomical differences of the brain during early childhood compared to other age-groups, population-specific deformable and probabilistic atlases are introduced. A method for generation of population-specific prior information in the form of a probabilistic atlas is proposed and used to enhance existing segmentation algorithms. The evaluation of registration-based and intensity-based approaches shows the techniques to be complementary in the quality of automatic segmentation in different parts of the brain. We propose a novel robust segmentation method combining the advantages of both approaches. The method is based on multiple label propagation using B-spline non-rigid registration followed by EM segmentation. Intensity in homogeneity is a shading artefact resulting from the acquisition process, which significantly affects modern high resolution MR data acquired at higher magnetic field strengths. A novel template based method focused on correcting the intensity inhomogeneity in data acquired at higher magnetic field strengths is therefore proposed. The proposed segmentation method combined with proposed intensity in homogeneity correction method offers a robust tool for quantification of volumes and growth of brain structures during early childhood. The tool has been applied to 67 T1-weigted images of subject at one and two years of age.

=520  3\$aThe long term monitoring of cell cultures, to study their dynamic nature is important, although devices capable of doing this aren't available. Primiarily the reason for this is the bio-compatibility of the devices and this refers to both the devices' compatibility with the culture as well as its compatibility with the device. Glucose sensors fabricated in electropolymerised poly(phenol) were used for the study. The reproducibility of these devices was checked to assess their viability for large scale deployment. It was found that the intra-batch variation was within the norms of experimental error, although the inter-batch variation was significant. This is a feature that is inherent to hand made devices and some methods to mitigate this are discussed. The surface characterisation of the sensors showed that the polymer and enzyme sit mutually exclusive to each other on the surface. Using cyclic voltammetry, with ferrocyanideas the probe molecule, it was confirmed that the diffusion profile to the surface of the sensor was semi-infinite planar and that the electrochemistry was quasi-reversible. Infra-red and Raman spectroscopy and scanning electrochemical microscopy were used as well to study the films' morphology. The sensors were not toxic to 3T3 cell cultures, as the yield and cell viability were consistent with those of the control cultures. It was also seen that the initial degradation of the sensors' response was not entirely due to the loss in enzyme activity. Non-polarised sensors showed a decrease in sensitivity to glucose and a threshold concentration ca. 3 mM below which they showed no response to glucose, when they were removed from the culture. These effects were not seen before the sensors were placed in the culture and in protein free media, they were partially reversed over time.

=520  3\$aThe development of vaccines against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis to reduce the morbidity and mortality of meningococcal disease is a major public health priority. We developed a novel genetic screen for immunogens present on the bacterial surface using human immune sera with bactericidal activity. We found that two mutants lacking nmb1467 survived in high concentrations of sera from two patients, while the wild-type strain was killed. Biochemical assays using purified recombinant NMB1467 indicated that nmb1467 encodes an exopolyphosphatase (PPX) with the ability to hydrolyse inorganic polyphosphate (poly P). In addition, we demonstrated that the Δppx mutant has at least 2-fold more poly P than the wild-type strain. Therefore, we designated NMB1467 as PPX. We showed that N. meningitidis mutant lacking the ppx had an increased resistance against normal human complement system. Substitution of the glutamic acid at residue 147 of PPX with an alanine significantly reduced the enzymatic activity in vitro, and contributed to increased level of poly P in N. meningitidis and the resistance of bacteria against the complement-mediated killing. Levels of polysaccharide capsule and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) sialylation, two important virulence factors, were not affected by the loss of ppx in N. meningitidis. Using flow cytometry, we demonstrated that binding of factor H (fH), the negative regulator of the alternative pathway of complement activation, to the bacterial surface was increased in the strain lacking PPX. By Western blot analysis, we did not detect a significant change in the expression of the fH receptor, indicting another mechanism is involved in the fH binding to the bacterial surface and resistance of bacteria against complement-mediated killing.

=520  3\$aThis thesis presents a methodology to automatically determine a data memory organisation at compiletime, suitable to exploit data reuse and loop-level parallelization, in order to achieve high performanceand low power design for data-dominated applications. Moore?s Law has enabled more and more heterogeneouscomponents integrated on a single chip. However, there are challenges to extract maximumperformance from these hardware resources efficiently. Unlike previous approaches, which mainly focus on making efficient use of computational resources,our focus is on data memory organisation and input-output bandwidth considerations, which are thetypical stumbling block of existing hardware compilation schemes. To optimize accesses to large off-chip memories, an approach is adopted and formalized to identify datareuse opportunities in local scratch-pad memory. An approach is presented for evaluating differentdata reuse options in terms of the memory space required by buffering reused data and execution timefor loading the data to the local memories. Determining the data reuse design option that consumesthe least power or performs operations quickest with respect to a memory constraint is a NP-hardproblem. In this work, the problem of data reuse exploration for low-power designs is formulated asa Multiple-Choice Knapsack problem. Together with a proposed power model, the problem is solvedefficiently. An integer geometric programming framework is presented for exploring data reuse andloop-level parallelization within a single step. The objective is to find the design that achieves theshortest execution time for an application. We describe our approaches based on formal optimization techniques, and present some results fromapplying these approaches to several benchmarks that show the advantages of optimizing data memoryorganisation and of exposing the interaction between data memory system design and parallelismextraction to the compiler.

=520  3\$aThis thesis contains a study of the spaces of homomorphisms from hyperbolic triangle groups to finite groups of Lie type which leads to a number of deterministic, asymptotic,and probabilistic results on the (p1, p2, p3)-generation problem for finite groups of Lie type. Let G₀ = L(pn) be a finite simple group of Lie type over the finite field Fpn and let T = Tp1,p2,p3 be the hyperbolic triangle group (x,y : xp1 = yp2 = (xy)p3 = 1) where p1, p2, p3 are prime numbers satisfying the hyperbolic condition 1/p1 + 1/p2 + 1/p3 < 1. In general, the size of Hom(T,G₀) is a polynomial in q, where q = pn, whose degree gives the dimension of Hom(T,G), where G is the corresponding algebraic group, seen as a variety. Computing the precise size of Hom(T,G₀) or giving an asymptotic estimate leads to a number of applications. One can for example investigate whether or not there is an epimorphism in Hom(T,G₀). This is equivalent to determining whether or not G₀ is a (p1, p2, p3)-group. Asymptotically, one might be interested in determining the probability that a random homomorphism in Hom(T,G₀) is an epimorphism as |G₀|→∞ . Given a prime number p, one can also ask wether there are finitely, or infinitely many positive integers n such that L(pn) is a (p1, p2, p3)-group. We solve these problems for the following families of finite simple groups of Lie type of small rank: the classical groups PSL2(q), PSL3(q), PSU3(q) and the exceptional groups 2B2(q), 2G2(q), G2(q), 3D4(q). The methods involve the character theory and the subgroup structure of these groups. Following the concept of linear rigidity of a triple of elements in GLn(Fp), used in inverse Galois theory, we introduce the concept for a hyperbolic triple of primes to be rigid in a simple algebraic group G. The triple (p1, p2, p3) is rigid in G if the sum of the dimensions of the subvarieties of elements of order p1, p2, p3 in G is equal to 2 dim G. This is the minimum required for G(pn) to have a generating triple of elements of these orders. We formulate a conjecture that if (p1, p2, p3) is a rigid triple then given a prime p there are only finitely many positive integers n such that L(pn) is a (p1, p2, p3)-group. We prove this conjecture for the classical groups PSL2(q), PSL3(q), and PSU3(q) and show that it is consistent with the substantial results in the literature about Hurwitz groups (i.e. when (p1, p2, p3) = (2, 3, 7)). We also classify the rigid hyperbolic triples of primes in algebraic groups, and in doing so we obtain some new families of non-Hurwitz groups.

=520  3\$aThe only sphingolipid occurring naturally in mammalian cells, sphingomyelin (SM) is of great importance. Having predominantly long, saturated acyl chains it has an unusually high melting temperature (around physiological temperature) and has been strongly associated with lipid microdomains often referred to as 'lipid rafts'. These domains are proposed to be enriched in SM and cholesterol (Chol) and have been linked to many cell processes and disease states. Despite the important role SM plays in the cell membrane, there is relatively little published data available in the literature. The first chapter of this work investigates the behaviour of SM from three natural sources, bovine brain (BBSM), egg yolk (EYSM) and milk (MSM). This allows a comparison of the phase behaviour in terms of the different chain compositions in each extract. The results show that the extracts differ in their gel phase structures and we present the first x-ray diffraction data for a ripple phase (Pβ') in BBSM and EYSM. At sufficiently high concentrations, Chol acts to disrupt the gel phase (Lβ) and order the fluid phase (Lα) of SM, leading to the formation of the 'intermediate' liquid ordered (Lo) phase. This phase retains characteristics of both the Lβ and Lα phases and has been strongly associated with lipid rafts. Using a combination of x-ray diffraction and ³¹P solid-state NMR, we have investigated the disruption of the gel phase of BBSM at low Chol concentrations. The results show disruption of the regular packing of the gel phase and also the removal of the ripple phase at 15mol% Chol. Finally, time-resolved x-ray diffraction techniques were utilised to investigate the kinetics of the different lamellar transitions observed. The Lβ to Lα and the Pβ' to Lα transitions are compared in MSM and BBSM.

=520  3\$aIn the field of Non-Destructive Testing, Potential Drop (PD) techniques have beenused for decades, especially in the petrochemical and power generation industries,for monitoring crack growth and wall thickness variations due to corrosion and/orerosion in pipes, pressure vessels and other structures. Inspection is carried out by injecting currents in the specimen to be tested andmeasuring the arising electrical potential di erence between two or more electrodesplaced on its surface. The presence of a defect generally increases the resistance andhence the measured voltage drop; inversion of these data can give information onthe size and shape of the defect. However, while the principle underlying these techniques is relatively simple, somedi culties have been encountered in their practical applications. Many commercialsystems based on PD methods, for instance, require the injection of very largecurrents in order to obtain su ciently large signals; doubts have been raised onthe stability of these methods to variations in the contact resistance between theelectrodes and the inspected material. The present work aims to show that someof these problems can be easily overcome, and to evaluate the capabilities of PDtechniques for crack sizing and corrosion mapping. After a brief review of the advantages, disadvantages and applications of the mainelectromagnetic methods for Non-Destructive Testing, an experimental setup forPotential Drop measurements which was developed for this work and which usessmall alternating currents (AC) is described. The setup is benchmarked against existingPD systems and then used to validate a model that allows AC PD simulationsto be run with a commercial Finite Element code. The results of both numericalsimulations and experimental measurements are used to investigate the possibilityof sizing defects of complex geometry by repeating the analysis at several di erentfrequencies over a broad range, and of reconstructing the depth pro le of surfacebreakingdefects without the need for assumptions on their shape. Subsequently, the accuracy to which it is possible to obtain maps of corrosion/erosion on the far surfaceof an inspected structure is discussed, and results obtained with an array probethat employs a novel arrangement of electrodes are presented. Finally, conclusionsare drawn and suggestions for further research are made.

=520  3\$aThis thesis concerns robust load allocation in communication networks. The main goal of this work is to avoid the situation in which the failure of a node (or nodes) causes a cascade of failures through an entire network, with a sequence of healthy nodes becoming overloaded and failing from picking up the slack from previously failed nodes. The network should remain functional even after some of the nodes have failed. In the dissertation we present a new methodology for dynamically distributing the load across a network so as to avoid the overloading of any of the networks' nodes. A numerical solution is proposed to solve this model and build a simulation tool. This numerical method adjusts the classic explicit form of Runge-Kutta 4th order in order to integrate graph principles and produce synchronized numerical solutions for each network element. Unlike most solutions in the literature, as for example, Motter et al. [2002], Motter and Adilson [2004], Liang et al. [2004], Schafer et al. [2006], Wang and Kim [2007] and Pinget et al. [2007] our methodology is generic in the sense that it works on any network topology. This means not only that it is applicable to a large range of networks, but also that it continues to be relevant after failure has destroyed part of a network, thereby changing the topology. In particular, geographical catastrophes can be of both random and intended types, taking place within a heterogeneous physical environment, on a civil (populated) area. Unlike most fault methodologies in the literature our methodology is generic in the sense that it simulates real-world geographic failure propagation towards any type of network which can be embedded to a two dimenional metric system [Chen and He, 2004], Liu et al. [2000], Callaway et al. [2000], Albert and Barabasi [2000]. It describes how physical one dimensional catastrophic waves spread in heterogeneous environments and how built-in resilience, within each network element determines its percentage of damage. We have tested our system on various randomly generated graphs with faults injected according to a model we have developed that simulates real-world geographic failure propagation. We present results from our dynamic traffic distribution methodology applied to networks, which have been either under attack or not. Throughout our case studies we prove that as soon as the topology is assigned the appropriate resources comparing to the load that it is to serve, our methodology successfully redistributes the load across the network and prevents a potential cascade failure. We either prevent the propagation of cascading failures or suggest recovery strategies after an unavoidable failure. Therefore, our methodology is instrumental in designing and testing reliable and robust networks.

A broadlyscoped numerical model is developed and described in this thesis to simulate the dynamic interactionof multi-fluid and solid systems. It is particularly aimed at modelling the interactionof two immiscible fluids with solid structures in a coastal engineering context; however it canbe extended to other similar areas of research. The Navier Stokes equations governing thefluids are solved using a combination of finite element (FEM) and control volume finite element(CVFE) discretisations. The sharp interface between the fluids is obtained through thecompressive transport of material properties (e.g. material concentration). This behaviour isachieved through the CVFE method and a conveniently limited flux calculation scheme basedon the Hyper-C method by Leonard (1991). Analytical and validation test cases are provided,consisting of steady and unsteady flows. To further enhance the method, improve accuracy, andexploit Lagrangian benefits, a novel moving mesh method is also introduced and tested. It isessentially an Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian method in which the grid velocity is defined bysemi-explicitly solving an iterative functional minimisation problem. A multi-phase approach is used to introduce solid structure modelling. In this approach,solution of the velocity field for the fluid phase is obtained using Model B as explained byGidaspow (1994, page 151). Interaction between the fluid phase and the solids is achievedthrough the means of a source term included in the fluid momentum equations. The interactingforce is calculated through integration of this source term and adding a buoyancy contribution. The resulting force is passed to an external solid-dynamics model such as the Discrete ElementMethod (DEM), or the combined Finite Discrete Element Method (FEMDEM).The versatility and novelty of this combined modelling approach stems from its ability tocapture the fluid interaction with particles of random size and shape. Each of the three maincomponents of this thesis: the advection scheme, the moving mesh method, and the solid interactionare individually validated, and examples of randomly shaped and sized particles areshown. To conclude the work, the methods are combined together in the context of coastal engineeringapplications, where the complex coupled problem of waves impacting on breakwateramour units is chosen to demonstrate the simulation possibilities. The three components developedin this thesis significantly extend the application range of already powerful tools, suchas Fluidity, for fluids-modelling and finite discrete element solids-modelling tools by bringingthem together for the first time.

=520  3\$aThis work uses a broad range of optoelectronic characterisation techniques tounderstand ? at a fundamental level ? the operating mechanisms of PLEDs. Theelectromodulation (EM) technique particularly provides a straightforward means ofdetermining the electric field strength inside operational devices, and is used here toinvestigate the improved device performance due to the insertion of an interlayerbetween the anode and the emissive layer. The effects of different interlayer materials(hole-transporting polymeric materials and one crosslinkable material) are studied in red,green and blue PLEDs. Interlayer devices yield better efficiencies and longer lifetimes,which can be attributed to charge accumulation near the anode/interlayer and (or)interlayer/emissive layer interfaces indicated by EM measurements. A promising alternative anode material ? vapour phase polymerised poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy thiophene)] (VPP-PEDOT) is another major focus of this thesis. Togetherwith poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), VPP-PEDOT is aviable alternative anode to indium tin oxide (ITO), capable of yielding superior efficienciesin otherwise identical PLEDs. Finally, a simulation code is developed for organic semiconductor devices tosystematically study the charge and electric field distributions in model devices. Thiscode, based on drift-diffusion model, can be used to study light-emitting electrochemicalcells (LECs). The simulation results indicate that there are high electric fields at bothelectrodes due to ionic charge distribution, which in turn facilitates electronic chargeinjection and thus leads to high recombination rates and luminous efficiencies.

=520  3\$aParasites can impose fitness effects on host populations: there may be seasonal and geographic variation in the interaction as well as over a longer time scale, host-parasite cospeciation. I investigate the Leucocytozoa parasites of birds as a model system to try to understand the role of diversity of infection, dispersal and scale on the nature of the coevolutionary process between the hosts and parasites. Leucocytozoa had effects on the breeding success of a population of the blue tit, Cyanistes caeruleus. Number of infections was important, and old birds infected with mixed lineage infections raised broods of significantly lower quality than those infected by a single lineage or uninfected birds. There was also evidence for individual lineage effects. The parasites showed seasonal dynamics, and overall prevalence followed a model previously proposed for the dynamics of avian malaria. Individual lineages, however, displayed different dynamics; this emphasises the importance of consideration of lineage identity. These results may have consequences for the evolutionary dynamics of this host-parasite interaction. The geographic context of the Leucocytozoa-bird interaction was investigated, and little phylogeographic structuring was found in parasite lineages across Europe. Contrary to predictions, the distribution of individual lineages followed the abundance-occupancy relationship, suggestive of widespread dispersal. At a larger phylogenetic scale I looked for evidence of host-parasite cospeciation in this system. There was a strong signal of coevolution due to cospeciation in 40% of the host-parasite associations. Migrant hosts harboured significantly fewer cospeciating parasites than residents and partial migrants. The implications and potential applications of this type of cospeciation analysis are discussed. I conclude by suggesting that the bird-Leucocytozoon system is an excellent model system for the study of host-parasite interactions, attaining high diversity and prevalence in some cases. Furthermore, the role of diversity, mixed lineage infections and dispersal are key to our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of this system.

=520  3\$aRetinal prostheses require the presence of viable population of cells in the inner retina. Evaluations of retina with Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) have shown a large number of cells remain in the inner retina compared with the outer retina. Therefore, vision loss caused by AMD and RP is potentially treatable with retinal prostheses. Photostimulation based retinal prostheses have shown many advantages compared with retinal implants. In contrary to electrode based stimulation, light does not require mechanical contact. Therefore, the system can be completely external and does not have the power and degradation problems of implanted devices. In addition, the stimulating point is flexible and does not require a prior decision on the stimulation location. Furthermore, a beam of light can be projected on tissue with both temporal and spatial precision. This thesis aims at finding a feasible solution to such a system. Firstly, a prototype of an optoelectronic stimulator was proposed and implemented by using the Xilinx Virtex-4 FPGA evaluation board. The platform was used to demonstrate the possibility of photostimulation of the photosensitized neurons. Meanwhile, with the aim of developing a portable retinal prosthesis, a system on chip (SoC) architecture was proposed and a wide tuning range sinusoidal voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) which is the pivotal component of the system was designed. The VCO is based on a new designed Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA) which achieves a good linearity over a wide tuning range. Both the OTA and the VCO were fabricated in the AMS0.35 μm CMOS process. Finally a 9X9 CMOS image sensor with spiking pixels was designed. Each pixel acts as an independent oscillator whose frequency is controlled by the incident light intensity. The sensor was fabricated in the AMS 0.35 μm CMOS Opto Process. Experimental validation and measured results are provided.

=520  3\$aHuman CD36 is a class B scavenger receptor expressed in a variety of cell types such as macrophage and adipocytes. This plasma membrane glycoprotein has a wide range of ligands including oxidised low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and long chain fatty acids which involves the receptor in diseases such as atherosclerosis and insulin resistance. CD36 is heavily modified post-translationally by N-linked glycosylation and ten putative N-linked glycosylation sites situated in the large extracellular loop of the protein have been identified, however their utilisation and role in the folding and function of the protein have not been characterised. Using mass spectrometry on purified and PNGaseF-deglycosylated CD36, and also by comparing the electrophoretic mobility of different glycosylation-site mutants, this study determined that nine of the ten sites can be modified by glycosylation. Flow cytometric analysis of the different glycosylation mutants expressed in mammalian cells, established that glycosylation is necessary for trafficking to the plasma membrane. Minimally-glycosylated mutants that supported trafficking were identified and indicated the importance of carboxy-terminal sites N247, N321 and N417 and amino-terminal sites N102 and N205. However, unlike the related mouse scavenger receptor SR-BI, no individual site was found to be essential for proper trafficking of CD36. Surprisingly, these minimally-glycosylated mutants appear to be predominantly core glycosylated indicating that mature glycosylation is not necessary for surface expression in mammalian cells. The data also show that neither the nature nor the pattern of glycosylation is relevant to binding of modified LDL.

=520  3\$aThis PhD thesis addresses the question of how we define, measure and improve surgical judgment and decision making, and how junior surgeons may be trained in these skills. The introduction to the thesis outlines the importance of surgical decision making, and the rationale for undertaking this research. An overview of relevant cognitive psychology research is presented, and the methodologies used in the experimental chapters of the thesis are described in detail. The introduction concludes with a systematic review of published empirical work on surgical decision making. The first two empirical studies are qualitative in nature, using interviews and simulation. They address how we define surgical decisions and their relationship to the process of care, including how surgeons subjectively view their own decision making, and whether we can draw inferences from observation of the process in action. Subsequent experimental chapters focus on the measurement of the quality of judgments of risk - a pre-decisional process in which likely outcomes of surgery are evaluated and estimated. Judgment analysis methodology is used to measure surgeons' performance at estimating surgical risks, with evaluation of whether the method shows construct validity, and whether feedback derived from judgment analysis tasks can be used as a teaching tool. The final empirical section of the thesis develops the theme of training junior surgeons in understanding risk and becoming better decision-makers. The process of developing, piloting, implementing and evaluating of a course module aiming to improve surgical trainees' approaches to decision making is presented. Finally the discussion reflects on the strengths and weaknesses of the studies, and outlines the implications of the work for clinical practice, training of junior surgeons, and future research.

=520  3\$aIn this thesis new methods have been developed for the recovery of past surface temperaturevariations from underground temperature-depth profiles. This has been undertakenfrom a Bayesian standpoint with an emphasis on model comparison, which allowsdifferently parameterised inverse models (inferred past temperature histories) to be automaticallyconstructed and compared in the light of the data and the prescribed priorinformation. In the first contribution a new method for inverting temperature-depth profiles ispresented which relies on trans-dimensional Bayesian sampling. The temperature historiesare parameterised in terms of a variable number of linear segments over time. Relying onthe natural parsimony of Bayesian inference, whereby simpler models which can adequatelyexplain the data are preferred, the complexity or roughness of the temperature historiescan be determined without the need for explicit a priori smoothing. This method thereforeallows a more objective inference of the past temperature changes. These concepts are extended to the spatial domain in the following chapter using themethod of Bayesian partition modelling. This seeks to find the posterior distribution ofthe number and spatial distribution of independent temperature histories given a spatiallydistributed ensemble of temperature-depth profiles. The results from applicationto 23 real boreholes in the UK are discussed in detail and show a clear preference for8 or 9 independent (and mostly contrasting) temperature histories. It is thus concludedthat the majority of these data cannot be considered as reliable sources of palaeoclimatereconstruction. A 3D finite element heat transfer forward model is developed in the latter part of thethesis, and is used to simulate underground temperatures. This forward model is linked to the first of the two Bayesian inverse methods described above. The effect of the reductionin average ground surface temperature with altitude is included in the forward model andinversion of the resultant profiles using a 1D forward model is shown to give significantdiscrepancies in the inferred temperature histories. Finally the inversion results fromthe Bayesian formulation are compared with those using a conventional gradient descentmethod. The thesis concludes with some possibilities for future research in this field which buildsupon the work presented herein.

=520  3\$aLow back pain is a common problem, which has been linked to repetitive lifting and highloading. Previous studies investigating the relationship between lifting and spinal load shave failed to consider the separate elements of the back. This study aims to compare different lifting techniques (weightlifting and manual handling) using a multi-segmental model of the spine. The loading and movement characteristics of the lumbo-pelvic joint during sagitally symmetric lifting were investigated. Kinematic and kinetic data were acquired with the 'Flock of Birds' electromagnetic sensors and a custom-built forceplate. Weighted boxes and Olympic barbells were used to simulate occupational lifting and athletic weightlifting respectively. The results indicate a shift to back-driven lifting and a reliance on the momentum of the upper body to move heavier weights. Over-extension of lumbar spine and pelvis during the heavy lifts implies the increased role of the hip and back extensors in force production. Moment did not increase significantly with load suggesting a physiological limit to the moment that can be generated by the muscles; other factors must affect lifting ability once this maximum has been reached. A simultaneous study investigated the potential of the 'balance board' method for measuring pelvic segment mass. Despite previous studies reporting the ease and accuracy of this method for measuring segmental mass, the results were not deemed to be sufficiently accurate for use. This is the first study that attempts to compare lifting technique between subjects with differing types and levels of training. Some training effects were seen to transfer between tasks. These findings would imply that a compromise might be reached, combining the advantages of manual handling and competitive lifting, which could result in a safer and more effective lifting technique. From a clinical perspective, this may be helpful in both treating patients and reducing healthcare costs.

=520  3\$aTrapped modes within elastic waveguides are investigated employing asymptotic and numericalmethods. The problems considered in this thesis concentrate on linear elastic wavesin thickened/thinned and curved waveguides. The localised modes are propagating withinsome region that is characterized by a small parameter but are cut-off for geometric reasonsexterior to that region, and thereafter exponentially decay with distance along the waveguide. Given this physical interpretation long wave theories become appropriate. The generalapproach is as follows: an asymptotic scheme is developed to analyse whether trappedmodes should be expected and to obtain the frequencies at which trapped modes are excited. The asymptotic approach leads to an ordinary differential equation eigenvalue problem thatencapsulates the essential physics. Then, numerical simulations based on spectral methodsare performed for this reduced equation and for the full elasticity equations to validate theasymptotic scheme and demonstrate its accuracy. The thesis begins with an investigation of trapping due to thickness variations. Thelong-wave model for trapped modes is derived and it is shown that this model is functionallythe same as that for a bent plate. Careful computations of the exact governing equations arecompared with the asymptotic theory to demonstrate that the theories tie together. Differentboundary conditions upon the guide walls and the importance of the sign of the groupvelocity are discussed in detail. Then, it is shown that boundary conditions also play a crucial role in the possible existenceof trapped modes. The possibility of trapped modes is considered in nonuniformelastic/ ocean/ quantum waveguides where the guide has one wall with Dirichlet (clamped)boundary conditions and the other Neumann (stress-free) boundary conditions. For bentwaveguides, with such boundary conditions, the sign of the curvature function is shown to play an important role in the possibility of trapping. Trapped modes in 3D elastic plates are considered as a model of waves that are guidedalong, and localised to the vicinity of, welds. These waves propagate unattenuated alongthe weld and exponentially decay with distance transverse to it. Three-dimensional geometriesintroduce additional complications but, again, asymptotic analysis is possible. Thelong-wave model provides numerical values of the trapped mode frequencies and givesconditions at which trapping can occur; these depend on the components of the wave numberin different directions and variations of the plate thickness. To mimic the guide stretching out to infinity a perfectly matched layer (PML) techniqueoriginally developed by Berenger for electromagnetic wave propagation is employed. Themethod is illustrated on the example of topographically varying and bent acoustic guides,and numerically implemented in the spectral scheme to construct dispersion curves for atwo-dimensional circular elastic annulus immersed in infinite fluid. This numerical schemeis new and more efficient than direct root-finding methods for the exact dispersion relationinvolving the Bessel functions. In the final chapter, the influence of external fluid on trapping within elastic waveguidesis considered. A long-wave scheme for a curved and thickening plates in infinite fluid isderived, conditions of existence of trapping are analysed and compared with those for platesin vacuum.

=520  3\$aBackground: Schistosomiasis remains one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases in developing countries. Goal and objectives: The potential relationship between Schistosoma mansoni and anaemia, was examined using Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) data on Ugandan children and a randomized clinical trial implemented by colleagues from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) in Western Kenya. The impact of large-scale administration of chemotherapy on Schistosoma haematobium infection and associated morbidity was also evaluated using SCI data on Burkinabe children. Evaluation and validation of field applicable tools, such as ultrasound, for the cost-effective diagnosis of schistosomiasis morbidity using SCI baseline data from Malian children was another aim of this thesis. Furthermore, in combination with the ultrasound scans, microscopic examination of urine for detection of S. haematobium eggs, dipsticks for detection of haematuria, tests for circulating antigens and serology tests were examined for the cost-effective assessment of S. haematobium prevalence in an adult's dataset from Ghana. Methods: Biostatistical analysis of aforementioned data was applied. Principal findings: Results from SCI and LSHTM studies suggest that anaemia is associated with schistosomiasis in African children, and that such anaemia shows a significant improvement following chemotherapy. Results from the SCI study in Burkina Faso suggested that even a single round of mass chemotherapy can have a substantial impact on S. haematobium infection and its associated morbidity in children. Microscopy and haematuria dipsticks were suggested as sensitive and specific indicators of prevalence of S. haematobium infection in Ghanaian adults. Furthermore, ultrasound global scores were demonstrated to be valuable markers in children for morbidity caused by S. haematobium infection, but ultrasonographic examination is not a reasonable substitute for microscopy or dipsticks for determining the prevalence of this infection. Significance: Finally, the key findings from all the studies presented, emphasizing how these relate to one another, are discussed.

=520  3\$aThis thesis presents an experimental study designed for the characterization of the tablettingbehaviors of Starch 1500?, Starcap 1500?, LHPC LH-11 and LHPC LH-B1, chosen for their displayof self-lubrication properties, in the form of efficient stress transmission, low ejection forcesand anti-capping propensities, with two specific aims:Firstly, the mechanisms underlying the tabletting performance of the materials were investigated. Secondly, in order to develop a robust experimental characterization method, the value ofthe experimental indicators used in this work was assessed. The time dependence of plastic flow was evidenced through a strain rate sensitivity study: thevariations of a set of experimental parameters with the compaction rate were observed. On theone hand, the axial (AER) and diametral (DER) tablet relaxations provided an indirect measureof the elastic deformation of the powder bed. On the other hand, the Heckel Yield Stress (?yH),Kawakita parameters a and b, and the maximum stress transmission coefficient (STCM), allowedan evaluation of the extent of plastic flow. Secondly, the initial (SRR0), final (SRRF) and average (SRRAv) stress relaxation rates, as wellas the proportion of stress lost during relaxation (?PM) of the four powders were quantified fromstress relaxation experiments. Also, a new approach based on linear combinations of exponentialdecay functions, was proposed for the analysis of stress relaxation curves obtained for powderbeds. Finally, the maximum ejection force and profiles, used in conjunction with the unejected compactsurface roughness and the final tablet shape served to elucidate the different relaxation phenomenataking place during the unloading and ejection phases, as well as investigate die wallfriction. The mechanical strength of the final tablets allowed an estimation of the final particlecohesion achieved. The major finding of this work is that the tabletting behaviors of the powders result from thespecific balance between their degrees of plastic and elastic deformations. More precisely, plasticflow governs the compact consolidation through interparticulate bonding, but also the strengthof the adhesive junctions formed between the tablet and the die wall, responsible for friction. Axial elastic recovery of the tablet during unloading causes the weakening of interparticulatebonds through their stretching, but also the cleavage of the compact-die wall plastic junctionsand thus a reduction in the friction force between them. The fine-tuning of these two phenomenacould lead to the formation of a tablet of satisfactory mechanical strength with minimal die wallfriction.

=520  3\$aThe work presented in this thesis describes the X-ray crystallographic studies of particulatemethane monoxygenase (pMMO) from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), thioredoxin A(BsTrxA) from Bacillus subtilis and arginine decarboxylase (AdiA) from Escherichia coli.1. pMMO is a respiratory enzyme that catalyses the first step in the metabolic pathway inmethanotrophic bacteria by converting methane to methanol. The crystal structure of thisintegral membrane protein was determined by molecular replacement to 3.5 ? resolution. The three metal sites in pMMO were confirmed to be a mononuclear copper site, adinuclear copper site and a mononuclear zinc site.2. Thioredoxin is a ubiquitous protein present in nearly all known organisms. Its purposein the cell is to maintain cysteine-containing proteins in the reduced state by convertingintramolecular disulfide bonds to dithiols in a redox reaction. The crystal structure of anactive site mutant of BsTrxA was determined by molecular replacement to 1.5 ?resolution. The structure shows a homodimer that resembles enzyme-substrate reactionintermediates.3. AdiA is a vitamin B6-dependent enzyme that catalyses the decarboxylation of arginineinto agmatine. It forms a part of an enzymatic system in E. coli that contribute to makingthis organism acid resistant. The structure of arginine decarboxylase (AdiA) from E. coliwas determined by multiple isomorphous replacement and anomalous scattering (MIRAS)methods to 2.4 ? resolution. The structure revealed a ~800 kDa decamer composed as apentamer of five homodimers. AdiA becomes active as the cellular environment becomesmore acidic. The structure of AdiA suggests how functional decamers associate withdecreasing pH or disassociates into inactive homodimers with increasing pH. The enzymemechanism and determinants for substrate specificity are discussed within the frameworkof the structure and comparisons with related structures are made.

=520  3\$aThe flow of immiscible liquids in pipelines has been studied in this work in order to formulatea one-dimensional model for the computer analysis of two-phase liquid-liquid flow in horizontalpipes. The model simplifies the number of flow patterns commonly encountered in liquid-liquidflow to stratified flow, fully dispersed flow and partial dispersion with the formation of one ortwo different emulsions. The model is based on the solution of continuity equations for dispersedand continuous phase; correlations available in the literature are used for the calculation of themaximum and mean dispersed phase drop diameter, the emulsion viscosity, the phase inversionpoint, the liquid-wall friction factors, liquid-liquid friction factors at interface and the slipvelocity between the phases. In absence of validated models for entrainment and depositionin liquid-liquid flow, two entrainment rate correlations and two deposition models originallydeveloped for gas-liquid flow have been adapted to liquid-liquid flow. The model was appliedto the flow of oil and water; the predicted flow regimes have been presented as a functionof the input water fraction and mixture velocity and compared with experimental results,showing an overall good agreement between calculation and experiments. Calculated valuesof oil-in-water and water-in-oil dispersed fractions were compared against experimental datafor different oil and water superficial velocities, input water fractions and mixture velocities. Pressure losses calculated in the full developed flow region of the pipe, a crucial quantity inindustrial applications, are reasonably close to measured values. Discrepancies and possibleimprovements of the model are also discussed. The model for two-phase flow was extended to three-phase liquid-liquid-gas flow withinthe framework of the two-fluid model. The two liquid phases were treated as a unique liquidphase with properly averaged properties. The model for three-phase flow thus developed wasimplemented in an existing research code for the simulation of three-phase slug flow with theformation of emulsions in the liquid phase and phase inversion phenomena. Comparisons withexperimental data are presented.

=520  3\$aHigh-throughput microarray technology is here to stay, e.g. in oncology for tumour classification and gene expression profiling to predict cancer pathology and clinical outcome. The global objective of this thesis is to investigate multivariate methods that are suitable for this task. After introducing the problem and the biological background, an overview of multivariate regularisation methods is given in Chapter 3 and the binary classification problem is outlined (Chapter 4). The focus of applications presented in Chapters 5 to 7 is on sparse binary classifiers that are both parsimonious and interpretable. Particular emphasis is on sparse penalised likelihood and Bayesian variable selection models, all in the context of logistic regression. The thesis concludes with a final discussion chapter. The variable selection problem is particularly challenging here, since the number of variables is much larger than the sample size, which results in an ill-conditioned problem with many equally good solutions. Thus, one open problem is the stability of gene expression profiles. In a resampling study, various characteristics including stability are compared between a variety of classifiers applied to five gene expression data sets and validated on two independent data sets. Bayesian variable selection provides an alternative to resampling for estimating the uncertainty in the selection of genes. MCMC methods are used for model space exploration, but because of the high dimensionality standard algorithms are computationally expensive and/or result in poor Markov chain mixing. A novel MCMC algorithm is presented that uses the dependence structure between input variables for finding blocks of variables to be updated together. This drastically improves mixing while keeping the computational burden acceptable. Several algorithms are compared in a simulation study. In an ovarian cancer application in Chapter 7, the best-performing MCMC algorithms are combined with parallel tempering and compared with an alternative method.

=520  3\$aAllelic exclusion coupled to lineage and stage specific regulation ensure the Igk locus undergoes RAG mediated V-J recombination only at the small pre-BII stage of lymphocyte development. These mechanisms also ensure the final antigen receptor is monospecific and allow self-specific receptors to be recognised and altered at later stages of development. Allelic exclusion is controlled by mechanism involving either epigenetic based allele selection early in development or probabilistic activation of a single allele at the small pre-BII stage. Current models favour the probabilistic model based on an elegant GFP reporter system. We present a reappraisal of this model based on an absence of the originally detected probabilistic activation. We find the absence to be explained in part by an aberrant splice event generated by developmentally regulated Igk germline promoter usage. The activity of the promoter was investigated using in-vitro models of critical events during the B cell development but their role remains elusive. Intense investigation for the last 20 years has determined that chromatic regulation underpins the stage and lineage specification of rearrangement. The protein factors responsible for this regulation remain unknown. Using transgene reporters of cis-acting sequences and in-vitro model systems of B cell development, we find an involvement for members of the zinc finger family of Ikaros transcription factors, IRF4 and LEF1. We determined a bipartite role for Ikaros whereby its activity could both suppress rearrangement prior to pre-BCR signalling and promote rearrangement thereafter, possibly through an IRF4 based mechanism. Finally we present evidence for a role for Ikaros protein in later stages of B cell development. We find modulation of Ikaros activity directly influences the ability of cells to differentiate to the plasma cell fate. We used a transgenic model to allow genome-wide mapping of the transcriptional events regulated by Ikaros and find multiple small modulations of factors and pathways.

=520  3\$aLarge-scale genetic association studies are carried out with the hope of discovering single nucleotide polymorphisms involved in the etiology of complex diseases. We propose a coalescent-based model for association mapping which potentially increases the power to detect disease-susceptibility variants in genetic association studies with case-control and cohort design. The approach uses Bayesian partition modelling to cluster haplotypes with similar disease risks by exploiting evolutionary information. We focus on candidate gene regions and we split the chromosomal region of interest into sub-regions or windows of high linkage disequilibrium (LD) therein assuming a perfect phylogeny. The haplotype space is then partitioned into disjoint clusters within which the phenotype-haplotype association is assumed to be the same. The novelty of our approach consists in the fact that the distance used for clustering haplotypes has an evolutionary interpretation, as haplotypes are clustered according to the time to their most recent common mutation. Our approach is fully Bayesian and we develop Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms to sample efficiently over the space of possible partitions. We have also developed a Bayesian survival regression model for high-dimension and small sample size settings. We provide a Bayesian variable selection procedure and shrinkage tool by imposing shrinkage priors on the regression coefficients. We have developed a computationally efficient optimization algorithm to explore the posterior surface and find the maximum a posteriori estimates of the regression coefficients. We compare the performance of the proposed methods in simulation studies and using real datasets to both single-marker analyses and recently proposed multi-marker methods and show that our methods perform similarly in localizing the causal allele while yielding lower false positive rates. Moreover, our methods offer computational advantages over other multi-marker approaches.

=520  3\$aTNFα plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), however the mechanisms underlying its dysregulation are not completely understood. TNFα production by macrophages is dependent on their contact with synovial T cells. In an in vitro model of RA, peripheral blood lymphocytes stimulated with a cocktail of cytokines mimic this RA T cell effector function. This thesis defines and characterises the effector population of cytokine-activated human T cells through two different approaches. Studies presented here show that within a population of cytokine-activated T cells, CD4+CD45RO+CCR7-cells induce the highest levels of TNFα when co-cultured with monocytes. Cytokine-activated CD4+ memory T cells phenotypically and functionally resemble lymphocytes isolated from RA synovial tissue. The cytokine cocktail induces proliferation and differentiation of peripheral blood T cells into highly potent effectors. These cells upregulate specific activation markers, adhesion molecules and chemokine receptors; such as CD25, CD69, CD62L, VLA-4, LFA-1 and CXCR4 which directly or indirectly, contribute to the induction of TNFα. By defining the phenotype of the lymphocytes most capable of inducing TNFα in our model, I isolated a population of T cells on which to focus my studies. The molecular nature of contact-dependent monocyte activation by cytokine-activated T cells was further investigated through proteomic profiling of the T cell surface. Plasma membrane protein-enriched samples were resolved in one- and two-dimensions. Subsequent mass spectrometry identified two molecules of interest. CD97 was found to be highly expressed by cytokine-activated CD4+ memory T cells, and contributed to both the induction of monocyte TNFα and spontaneous TNFα release from rheumatoid synovial tissue. Expression of CD81 and other tetraspanin family members increased on cytokine activation and was observed in synovial tissue. The results presented in this thesis provide further insight into the contribution of T cells in RA.

=520  3\$aTranscriptional and histone modification profiles were analysed in detail across several regions of the mouse genome in order to examine how tissue-specificity is determined at early stages of development and how it is maintained during cell commitment. The analysis was mainly focused on a 2 Mb gene-dense region containing 68 known closely situated genes, having very diverse expression patterns. Transcriptional profiling of this region showed that clustered tissue-restricted and housekeeping genes are associated with clearly defined monovalent or bivalent epigenetic domains. In ES cells, the actively transcribed housekeeping genes were enriched for histone H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, H3K9ac and binding of Pol II. Most of the silent tissue-restricted genes were marked by bivalent domains and had background levels of Pol II. In few cases, substantial levels of Pol II were found at inactive genes situated close to housekeeping genes, suggesting that transcriptional read-through could be occurring at these genes in ES cells. Epigenetic profiling of the gene-dense region in LPS-activated B cells showed that B cells have a very similar histone modification profile to ES cells. Specifically, the analysis showed that bivalent domains which were thought to be a defining characteristic of pluripotent stem cells are equally prevalent in B cells, suggesting that the epigenetic marking of silent genes is quite similar in these two very different cell types. Analysis of a large gene-poor region containing four genes encoding GABAA neurotransmitter receptor subunits showed that the this locus acquires a large bivalent domain of approximately 1.3 Mb following differentiation of ES cells into NS cells and astrocytes. The results obtained in this study demonstrate the complex and diverse nature of histone modifications at tissue-restricted genes and suggest that trans-acting factors are responsible for generating highly specific combinations of histone modifications at each individual gene at different stages of cell differentiation.

=520  3\$aSevere asthma accounts for a small number of asthmatics but represents a disproportionate cost to health care systems. The underlying mechanism in severe asthma remains unknown and most of the cost is the result of inadequate treatment. Although the disease presents a very heterogeneous profile it displays a certain degree of resistance to corticosteroid therapy. It is hypothesized that corticosteroid insensitivity can be reversed pharmacologically. We investigated the effects of drugs which are currently used for treatment of asthma on glucocorticoid sensitivity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with mild, moderate and severe asthma and healthy volunteers. Long acting β2 receptor agonists (LABAs) were found to be able to reverse corticosteroid insensitivity in some severe asthmatic patients. These patients showed a defect of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) nuclear translocation with hyperphosphorylation of GR. Furthermore, LABAs were found to inhibit GR phosphorylation through inhibition of p38MAPKγ phosphorylation. Other severe asthmatic patients were also found to be 'responders' to theophylline, another current add-on treatment, and showed a defect in histone deacetylase activity. Further studies were conducted in order to find additional molecular abnormalities which may define novel add-on treatments to reverse corticosteroid resistance. Using simple laboratory methods in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by one blood sampling, analysis of GR nuclear translocation potential, GR dependent transrepression (IL-8, IL-2 inhibition) and GR-dependent transactivation (Histone-4 lysine-5 acetylation, GILZ expression) revealed a heterogeneous population in severe asthma. Low levels of corticosteroid response were associated with a decrease in lung function in severe asthma. The use of possible add-on treatments such as an IKK2 inhibitor, a PI3K inhibitor, macrolides and a p38MAPKα/β inhibitor as well as existing treatments (theophylline and formoterol) confirmed that different molecular mechanisms were involved in severe asthma and is possible to choose the best add-on treatment individually for each patient. Particularly, a p38MAPKα/β inhibitor was broadly effective in severe asthma. This screening might be useful in determining the underlying phenotype of each individual patient. In the last chapter, I evaluated the effects of nortriptyline hydrochloride (NH), which is a well-known compound but recently identified as a novel add-on treatment to corticosteroids. Studies using PBMCs showed that there were 'responders' and 'non-responders' to NH in severe asthma. Analysis by correlation with other compounds suggested that NH can modify PI3K signalling. In fact NH inhibited phosphorylation of Akt, a surrogate marker of PI3K under oxidative stress, and restored HDAC activity defective under oxidative stress. This new combination will be one of choice for the treatment of severe asthma. This thesis gives new insights on phenotyping of severe asthma patients and novel add-on treatments to corticosteroids, possibly leading to future tailor-made treatment.

=520  3\$aHumans can interact with their environment by tuning the properties of the musculoskeletal system to control force and impedance at the contact points with the environment. Many activities that require the use of tools, such as handling a screwdriver or chisel, involve an unstable interaction with the environment. This instability will amplify any disturbance or noise and cause unpredictable motion. For example, when chiselling a piece of rough wood, motor noise or involuntary movements can make the hand slip out of the desired track. When a single reaching movement is repeated in unstable dynamics, the central nervous system (CNS) learns to compensate for the instability by coordinating muscle in an appropriate way. However, it is still unclear how humans can learn to perform unstable tasks in various directions. Do they co-contract in an isotropic way to ensure good performance in all directions, or do they learn direction specific impedance? And what are the underlying processes of this adaptation?This thesis addresses those questions through psychophysical experiments in which arm movements were investigated as subjects interacted with computer controlled dynamics produced by a robotic interface, as well as by developing computational models of human motor learning. Observations of learning unstable dynamics simultaneously in two different directions show that the CNS is able to compensate for the instability specifically for each direction, by adapting impedance optimally to the environment. A computational model was developed to simulate human reaching movements in stable and unstable dynamics in various directions of the workspace. The model learns feedforward muscle tension by minimising movement error in muscle space and energy. The computer model is a useful tool to predict and investigate (generalisation in) motor learning. It can predict the results of our experiment as well as many motor learning observations in past experiments.

=520  3\$aBased on the published protein-protein interaction maps of five organisms and other public databases for domain-domain and protein-protein interactions, two new approaches are proposed to infer the protein-protein interaction network of the Anopheles gambiae (A. gambiae) mosquitoes. Our main contributions are: i) Adopted an orthologous protein pair transfer method that has so far not been seen in literature; ii) Proposed a new hybrid Bayes method; iii) Used voting machines at two levels of the combined classifier/predictor; iv) Used heterogeneous datasets as the training data; v) And finally, used the trained classifier to predict the protein interactions maps for A. gambiae, arguably one of a few least known organisms in terms of protein interaction mechanism. With the first method, the orthologous and in-paralogous protein clusters are extracted for both species. The relations between two peer-to-peer proteins in the two species are identified so that the interactions in the D. melanogaster protein interaction maps are transferred to pairs of interacting proteins in A. gambiae. The second strategy, namely the hybrid Bayes, is based on the domain composition of proteins, with which we utilize a probability model to build virtual domain-domain maps by integrating large-scale protein interaction data from five organisms, namely Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Escherichia coli, Mus musculus and Drosophila melanogaster. For the hybrid Bayes method, once the virtual domain-domain interaction maps are constructed, we propose two ways to predict the protein-protein interaction maps. These two methods are compared and then combined to form a voting machine to collectively decide a protein-pair's candidacy. The users could adjust the weights for different methods to flexibly control the output. Parameters are chosen through running different experiments on the training data set. While both the orthologous cluster and hybrid Bayes methods produce encouraging results the second one predicts more protein-protein interaction than the first. Yet these two data sets share a very small fraction of common interactions. We adopt a second voting machine and calibrate the parameters with the putative protein interaction data. Those parameters for the voting machine are used to predict the protein-protein interaction maps of the A. gambiae and produces reasonably good results.

=520  3\$aThe objective of this thesis is to investigate MC-CDMA MIMO systems where the antenna array geometry is taken into consideration. In most MC-CDMA systems, cyclic prefixes, which reduce the spectral efficiency, are used. In order to improve the spectral efficiency, this research study is focused on cyclic prefix-free MC-CDMA MIMO architectures. Initially, space-time wireless channel models are developed by considering the spatio-temporal mechanisms of the radio channel, such as multipath propagation. The spatio-temporal channel models are based on the concept of the array manifold vector, which enables the parametric modelling of the channel. The array manifold vector is extended to the multi-carrier space-time array (MC-STAR) manifold matrix which enables the use of spatio-temporal signal processing techniques. Based on the modelling, a new cyclic prefix-free MC-CDMA arrayed MIMO communication system is proposed and its performance is compared with a representative existing system. Furthermore, a MUSIC-type algorithm is then developed for the estimation of the channel parameters of the received signal. This proposed cyclic prefix-free MC-CDMA arrayed MIMO system is then extended to consider the effects of spatial diffusion in the wireless channel. Spatial diffusion is an important channel impairment which is often ignored and the failure to consider such effects leads to less than satisfactory performance. A subspace-based approach is proposed for the estimation of the channel parameters and spatial spread and reception of the desired signal. Finally, the problem of joint optimization of the transmit and receive beam-forming weights in the downlink of a cyclic prefix-free MC-CDMA arrayed MIMO communication system is investigated. A subcarrier-cooperative approach is used for the transmit beam forming so that there is greater flexibility in the allocation of channel symbols. The resulting optimization problem, with a per-antenna transmit power constraint, is solved by the Lagrange multiplier method and an iterative algorithm is proposed.

=520  3\$aType I interferon is a cytokine induced upon virus infection that generates an antiviral state in neighbouring cells. Historically, research into avian interferon has lagged behind that into the mammalian system and hence reagents and assays are poorly developed. The avipoxvirus Fowlpox virus is naturally host restricted to avian cells. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is an attenuated Vaccinia virus derived by serial passage in chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF), so that it too is now host restricted. In CEF pretreated with chicken interferon (ChIFN), plaque formation by Fowlpox virus (FP9 strain) was approximately 500-times less inhibited than MVA. A lack of bioinformatic clues within the FP9 genome sequence justified a broad-scale screen to identify any molecular determinants that contributed to this interferon resistance. The 266 kbp FP9 genome was divided into 61 overlapping fragments, each approximately 8 kbp long, to include each unique open reading frame (ORF) intact in at least one fragment. Splice-overlap-extension PCR protocols were optimised to assemble each genomic fragment with a guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (GPT) gene under the control of a poxvirus promoter, between two MVA flanks. These linear constructs were transfected into cells co-infected with MVA, for homologous recombination to insert the FP9 fragment and GPT cassette into the MVA genome. GPT-positive virus was enriched by culture with mycophenolic acid. In total, 65 recombinant viruses were recovered, representing 85% of the FP9 ORFs. Fourteen fragments were independently duplicated to control for mutations that may have been introduced during PCR. Recombinant viruses were screened for an increased ability to plaque in ChIFN-treated cells identifying 2 FP9 fragments, Fowlpox Interferon Resistance locus (FIR) 1 and FIR2. Further recombinant MVA viruses each containing a single gene from FIR1 were constructed and assessed for interferon resistance using the same techniques, identifying FP9.014 as contributing to FP9 ChIFN resistance.

=520  3\$aTo use the AKARI All-Sky Survey Point Source Catalogue as a validation sample for future missions such as Planck and to study large-scale structure, we first investigate the AKARI point source detection limit at 90 μm and the nature of bright spurious sources. Due to the degradation of the sensitivity of the AKARI All-Sky Survey and formidable difficulties in filtering out excessive noise, we return to the IRAS Faint Source Catalog to construct a redshift catalogue of over 60,000 galaxies selected at 60 μm, the Imperial IRAS-FSC Redshift Catalogue (IIFSCz). Around 50% of the sources in the IIFSCz have spectroscopic redshifts and a further 20% have photometric redshifts. The luminosity and selection functions are obtained for the IIFSCz flux-limited at 0.36 Jy at 60 μm. The dependence of galaxy clustering on spectral type and luminosity is studied using correlation statistics. A possible detection of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the power spectrum of the flux-limited sample of the IIFSCz is discussed. Finally, we present future research directions which include the FIR-radio correlation, ultraluminous and hyperluminous infrared galaxies, galaxy bias in the SWIRE Photometric Redshift Catalogue and convergence of the cosmological dipole.

=520  3\$aInjection and detection of spin polarised current in a metal/semiconductor deviceand the measurement of the degree of injected spin polarisation are two key issuesin the development of hybrid spintronics. This thesis touches on both themes asit details the development of planar Andreev spectroscopy as a tool to measureinjected spin and the electrical characterisation of MgO tunnel barriers for efficientspin injection and detection. Point contact Andreev reflection spectroscopy has been widely used tomeasuretransport spin polarisation in magnetic materials. Planar Andreev structures havean advantage over point contacts as they offer greater control over interface qualityand the possibility of spatially resolved information about the spin polarisationusing nanojunction arrays. We find that planar junctions compare favourably topoint contacts in that they can yield low interface barriers and minimal nonthermalsmearing. We show that a low interface barrier is critical for accurate detectionof spin polarisation, particularly in semiconductorswhere large Fermi velocitymismatchcontributes to the barrier. Furthermore, the fabrication method strongly affectsall parameter values. For Pb/InAs planar junctions we demonstrate that themost feasible way to obtain interfaces suitable for spin detection is an ?etch-back?processing strategy. The processing routes are shown to be scalable to nanoarrayfabrication to allow measurement of spin accumulation. We also examine the electrical properties of ultrathin MgO barriers grown onInAs epilayers and the dependence of barrier characteristics on InAs surface pretreatmentand growth conditions. Chemical pretreatment improves the yield oftunnel junctions and changes the roughness of the interface between the oxide andthe semiconductor. Electrical characterisation confirms that tunnel barriers withappropriate values of interface resistance for efficient spin injection/detection havebeen achieved. Using the Rowell criteria and various tunnelling models we showthat single step tunnelling occurs above 150 K and a thermal smearing model suggeststhat tunnelling is the dominant transport process down to 10 K.

=520  3\$aAsthma is an economically important disease, with exacerbations causing significant morbidity and morality. Viral infections cause ~80% of asthma exacerbations; the majority of which are attributed to rhinovirus infection. How rhinovirus infection leads to an acute asthma exacerbation is incompletely understood. The up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines from rhinovirus infected bronchial epithelial cells and an impaired ability of rhinovirus infected asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells to produce type I interferon-β and type III interferon-λs, are believed to contribute. This study aimed to investigate differences in the signalling requirements of rhinovirus induced pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines from those of IFN-β/IFN-λ. The viral pattern recognition receptors, signalling intermediates and transcription factors required by rhinovirus to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine and IFN-β/IFN-λ expression were explored using short interfering RNA, constitutive activation/overexpression of signalling molecules and IFN-β promoter reporter mapping experiments. The viral pattern recognition receptors RIG-I, MDA5 and TLR3 were required for rhinovirus-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8/CXCL8, ENA-78/CXCL5, IL-6 RANTES/CCL5, IP-10/CXCL10 and IFN-β expression. Only MDA5 and TLR3 are required for rhinovirus-induced IFN-λ expression. Whilst having common signalling intermediates, the adaptor protein TRAF6, the kinases JNK2 and PI3Kα and the transcription factor NF-κB p65 were not required for rhinovirus-induced IFN-β/λ expression, but were required for rhinovirus induction of some/all of the proinflammatory cytokines measured. IRF3 was the only transcription factor identified to be commonly required for rhinovirus-induced expression of IFN-β and IFN-λs. These findings support the hypothesis that the induction of IFN-β/λ and pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines, by rhinovirus, requires one or more distinct signalling molecules, and/or transcription factors. TRAF6, JNK2, PI3Kα and NF-κB p65 are potential novel therapeutic targets for rhinovirus-induced asthma exacerbations, the inhibition of which may suppress the detrimental actions of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines without inhibiting IFN-β/λ production in asthmatic bronchial epithelial cells.

=520  3\$aThe phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPns) and inositol phosphates (IPns) are intricately involved in cell signalling. They bind to a vast array of proteins, which results in a host of physiological responses. Therefore it is difficult to determine the precise downstream effects of an individual protein-phosphoinositide interaction. Perturbations of these networks occur in pathological conditions such as cancer and diabetes increasing the need to understand these systems. Receptor-Ligand Engineering (RLE) may provide the tools to map these interactions. Chemical modification of the small PIPn or IPn ligand and complementary mutation of binding site amino acids is used to create a unique protein-ligand binding pair. Once the modified protein is engineered into the cell line, the dose dependent effects of its stimulation with the complementary ligand can be studied in isolation from signal pathway cross-talk. Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2 / PIP2] and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 / PIP3] analogues with C-alkyl groups replacing the axial inositol C-Hprotons would be suitable ligands for RLE. To date, no such analogues are known in the literature. The key challenges in preparation of such compounds are selective protection and deprotection of the myo-inositol hydroxyls, introduction of new inositol C-substituents with retention of myostereochemistry,and phosphorylation of an unnatural tertiary centre. 4-C-Alkyl IP3 and 4-C-alkyl IP4 analogues were chosen as targets to explore the chemical limitations of analogue synthesis. Orthoesters simultaneously tied up the 1-, 3- and 5-O differentiating between the remaining three hydroxyls in a rigid structure. Oxidation of the isolated 4-OH to the inos-4-ose and selective reintroduction of the myo-geometry by addition of dimethylsulfoxonium methylide generated the key exo-methylene oxide intermediate. Lithium alkyl cyanocuprates were employed to open the exo-methylene oxide introducing primary, -secondary, and -tertiary alkyl and aryl protrusions. 4-C-Alkyl triols were prepared by regiocontrolled DIBAL-H reduction of the orthobenzoate to a benzyl ether, directed by the 4-C-alkyl protrusion. The corresponding 4-C-alkyltetrols were obtained by acidic hydrolysis of the orthobenzoate and cleavage of the resultant benzoate ester. All polyols were then phosphorylated and globally deprotected to generate the final series of 4-C-alkyl IP3 and IP4 analogues. Some initial investigations were also performed to extend this methodology to prepare 4-and 5-C-alkyl derivatives from a common precursor.

=520  3\$aMachining is a non-linear process and involves the consideration of variables such as inelasticdeformation, high temperatures and contact conditions. This thesis focuses on investigating thecontact conditions between cutting tools and polymeric materials during orthogonal cutting. Atest rig has been developed to allow cuts to be taken from a rectangular workpiece, such that therake angle (the angle of inclination of the tool surface) can be varied. In this work the rake angle was varied from -20o to 30o, and the cutting was performed at ratesof 0.01ms-1 and 0.1ms-1 on PMMA, nylon 4/6 and nylon 6/12. As part of a round robininvestigation, tests were also performed on HIPS, ABS and LLDPE.The experimental method developed required the measurement of forces in two directions (thedirection of cutting, Fc and transverse to the direction of cutting, Ft). The rig allowed for thecareful control of the depth of cut, h. After each cut, the thickness of the off-cut chip hc wasalso measured. A series of cuts were taken at depths varying between the range of 0.02mm to 0.25mm and theforces were measured. A cutting theory has been applied to the experimental data to determinethe fracture toughness Gc, and the yield stress ?Y of the material. The Coulomb friction ? andan adhesion term, Ga representing sticking at the tool-chip interface, were also deduced. Independent fracture mechanics tests were performed at a range of temperatures and rates on thedifferent polymers. Tensile tests were also performed, to compare standard values to thematerial parameters determined in cutting. The values of Gc and ?Y deduced were independentof the rake angle however, ? and Ga were not. The calculated values of Gc were typicallywithin 5% of the standard values however, ?Y was found to be up to 5 times higher. Theexistence of work hardening is believed to be the cause of these elevated values. The cutting analysis was also applied to some previously published metal cutting data andproduced constant values of Gc.

=520  3\$aThe scientific problems related to granular matter are ubiquitous. It is currently anactive area of research for physicists and earth scientists, with a wide range of applicationswithin the industrial community. Simple analogue experiments exhibit behaviour that isneither predicted nor described by any current theory. The work presented here consistsof modelling granular media using a two-dimensional combined Finite-Discrete ElementMethod (FEM-DEM). While computationally expensive, as well as modelling accuratelythe dynamic interactions between independent and arbitrarily shaped grains, this methodallows for a complete description of the stress state within individual grains during theirtransient motion. After a detailed description of FEM-DEM principles, this computational approach isused to investigate the packing of elliptical particles. The work is aimed at understandingthe influence of the particle shape (the ellipse aspect ratio) on the emergent properties ofthe granular matrix such as the particle coordination number and the packing density. Thediff erences in microstructure of the resultant packing are analysed using pair correlationfunctions, particle orientations and pore size distributions. A comparison between frictionaland frictionless systems is carried out. It shows great diff erences not only in the calculatedporosity and coordination number, but also in terms of structural arrangement and stressdistribution. The results suggest that the particle s shape a ffects the structural order of theparticle assemblage, which itself controls the stress distribution between the pseudo-staticgrains. The study then focuses on describing the stress patterns or \force chains" naturallygenerated in a frictional system. An algorithm based on the analysis of the contactforce network is proposed and applied to various packs in order to identify the forcechains. A statistical analysis of the force chains looking at their orientation, length andproportion of the particles that support the loads is then performed. It is observedthat force chains propagate less efficiently and more heterogeneously through granularsystems made of elliptical particles than through systems of discs and it is proposedthat structural diff erences due to the particle shape lead to a signifi cant reduction in the length of the stress path that propagates across connected particles. Finally, the e ffectof compression on the granular packing, the emergent properties and the contact forcedistribution is examined. Results show that the force network evolves towards a morerandomly distributed system (from an exponential to a Gaussian distribution), and itconfi rms the observations made from simulations using discs. To conclude, the combined finite-discrete element method applied to the study ofgranular systems provides an attractive modelling strategy to improve the knowledge ofgranular matter. This is due to the wide range of static and dynamic problems that can betreated with a rigorous physical basis. The applicability of the method was demonstratedthrough to a variety of problems that involve di fferent physical processes modelled withthe FEM-DEM (internal deformations, fracture, and complex geometry). With the rapidextension of the practical limits of computational models, this work emphasizes theopportunity to move towards a modern generation of computer software to understandthe complexity of the phenomena associated with discontinua.

=520  3\$aTristetraprolin (TTP), butyrate response factor 1 (BRF1) and butyrate response factor 2 (BRF2) are members of a family of zinc finger containing ARE binding proteins known as the Zfp36 family. They all possess a conserved tandem zinc finger domain, which facilitates their binding to mRNAs that contain adenosine/uridine rich elements (ARE) in their 3' untranslated region (3'UTR). Binding to the target mRNA results in its destabilisation. Several mRNAs containing an ARE in their 3'UTR are stabilised by the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 pathway. Both the expression and the mRNA destabilising function of TTP are controlled by the p38 MAPK pathway. Much less is known about BRF1 and BRF2 functions, and it is not clear whether their expression or function is regulated by the p38 MAPK pathway. So far no difference has been seen in the binding specificities of the three proteins in vitro, however the phenotypes of knockout mice suggest that they have distinct functions, and may have different mRNA targets in vivo. Western blotting and quantitative PCR (qPCR) have been used to investigate the expression of members of the Zfp36 family. RNA interference was used to knock down the expression of BRF1 and BRF2 in HeLa cells, and the effects on p38-regulated inflammatory mediator expression were examined. BRF1-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines were used to investigate the function of this family member. No evidence that BRF1 or BRF2 contributes to the post-transcriptional regulation of inflammatory mediators by the p38 MAPK pathway in HeLa cells or MEFs was found. BRF1 null MEFs over-expressed IL-6, protein, IL-6 mRNA and Cox-2 mRNA but did not over-express KC protein. The hypothesis that BRF1 is regulating IL-6 and Cox-2 by controlling mRNA stability was disproved. As a result investigation of the transcriptional regulation of these genes was researched. Primary transcript qPCR showed that both IL-6 and Cox-2 undergo more rapid transcription in BRF1-/- MEFs. This suggests that IL-6 and Cox-2 are indirect targets of BRF1 and that their regulation is through a transcription factor which is itself a target of BRF1.

=520  3\$aTissue-specific genes have been found to be epigenetically marked in embryonic stem cells by different combination of histone modifications. These marks are believed to prime genes for activation at later stages of development. Previous work has revealed the presence of one such signature on one enhancer of the mouse λ5-VpreB1 locus, which is expressed at the pro- and pre-B cell stage of B lymphocyte development. This element, which has been called Early- Transcriptional Competence Mark (ETCM), is characterised by the presence of tightly localised peaks of histone H3K4 methylation and H3K9 acetylation. However, the ETCM lacks the trimethylation of H3K27 that defines bivalent domains at many tissue-specific genes in ES cells. The results described in this thesis show that that two ES cell transcription factors, Sox2 and Foxd3, bind to the λ5-VpreB1 ETCM in ES cells. Analysis of factor binding to the λ5-VpreB1 locus at the proB cell stage of B-cell development showed that the same sequences are occupied by the B-cell specific factors Sox4 and Foxp1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and microarray analysis (ChIP-on-Chip) showed that Sox2 and Foxd3 are bound to a number of ETCM-like elements in ES cells, as well as bivalent domains, suggesting that they are involved in the establishment and maintenance of these epigenetic marks in ES cells. Knockdown of Sox2 by siRNA confirmed its involvement in the methylation of H3K4 on these DNA regions. Based on these data, I propose a factor-relay model in which embryonic stem cell transcription factors generate epigenetic signatures at key regulatory elements of tissue-specific genes. During differentiation these proteins are replaced by related factors, which share their DNA-binding profile, and play an important role in activating tissue-specific transcription.

=520  3\$aIntroduction: Central nervous system tuberculosis (CNS TB) has a high mortality. Microglial derived matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are implicated in the intense inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) as the blood brain barrier is rich in MMP substrates. Methods: In a cellular model of CNS TB human microglial cells were stimulated with M.tb and conditioned media from M.tb infected human monocytes (CoMTb). Gene expression of all 23 MMPs and the 4 tissue inhibitors of MMP (TIMPs) was analysed by real time RT-PCR and secretion by Luminex and Western blotting. MMP gene transcription regulation was studied by luciferase promoter reporter assays and NFkB/AP-1 ELISAs. MAP kinases were studied by Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry of CNS TB biopsies and ELISA analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was performed. Results: CoMTb up-regulated expression of MMP-1, -3 and -9, which was suppressed by dexamethasone. In contrast CoMTb did not alter TIMP-1 and reduced TIMP-2, -3 and -4 expression. M.tb up-regulated MMP-1 and -3 secretion. However, CoMTb drove MMP-1 and -3 secretion more potently than M.tb but suppressed MMP-2 secretion. Nuclear NFkB p50-p65 heterodimers and AP-1 cJun/FosB increased in CoMTb stimulated cells, with concomitant degradation of IkBα. Mutation of NFkB and AP-1 sites in the MMP-1 promoter abrogated CoMTb promoter activity. CoMTb drove early p38 and ERK MAP kinase phosphorylation. Chemical inhibition of both NFkB and p38 returned MMP-1 and 3 secretion to control levels but enhanced MMP-2 secretion that was also caspase 8 dependent. MMP/TIMP concentrations in CSF samples from TBM patients were predictive of coma severity and outcome and demonstrated that dexamethasone preferentially suppressed MMP-9. Conclusions: In CNS TB unopposed MMP-1 and -3 expression and secretion are driven by M.tb-infected monocyte networks and regulated by p38, NFkB and AP-1. CSF MMP/TIMP concentrations predict disease severity and offer a mechanism for the beneficial effect of dexamethasone therapy.

=520  3\$aReconfigurable devices, such as Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), enable application-specific number representations. Well-known number formats include fixed-point, floating-point, logarithmic number system (LNS), and residue number system (RNS). Such different number representations lead to different arithmetic designs and error behaviours, thus produc-ing implementations with different performance, accuracy, and cost. To investigate the design options in number representations, the first part of this thesis presentsa platform that enables automated exploration of the number representation design space. Thesecond part of the thesis shows case studies that optimise the designs for area, latency orthroughput from the perspective of number representations. Automated design space exploration in the first part addresses the following two major issues: • Automation requires arithmetic unit generation. This thesis provides optimised arithmetic library generators for logarithmic and residue arithmetic units, which supporta wide range of bit widths and achieve significant improvement over previous designs. • Generation of arithmetic units requires specifying the bit widths for each variable. This thesis describes an automatic bit-width optimisation tool called R-Tool, which combines dynamic and static analysis methods, and supports different number systems (fixed-point, floating-point, and LNS numbers). Putting it all together, the second part explores the effects of application-specific number representation on practical benchmarks, such as radiative Monte Carlo simulation, and seismic imaging computations. Experimental results show that customising the number representations brings benefits to hardware implementations: by selecting a more appropriate number format, we can reduce the area cost by up to 73.5% and improve the throughput by 14.2% to 34.1%; by performing the bit-width optimisation, we can further reduce the area cost by 9.7% to 17.3%. On the performance side, hardware implementations with customised number formats achieve 5 to potentially over 40 times speedup over software implementations.

=520  3\$aDuring infection with Neisseria meningitidis, an important causative agent of bacterial meningitis and septicaemia, the host innate immune system clears bacteria by complement-mediated lysis and phagocytosis. In order to evade phagocytosis, the bacterium expresses a number of surface components, including a polysaccharide capsule and sialylated lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The aim of this project was to investigate the influence of bacterial metabolism and DNA repair on the interaction with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Results demonstrated reduced expression of the polysaccharide capsule and lowered LPS sialylation in a strain (ΔlctP) unable to acquire exogenous lactate, but no effect in a strain unable to utilise glutamate (ΔperM). These changes were associated with increased phagocytosis of fixed bacteria by the human PMN cell line, HL60. Further investigations showed that capsule expression in the ΔlctP strain was restored to wild-type levels following exposure of live bacteria to PMNs. Next, assays were established using primary human PMNs to investigate post-phagocytic events. The wild-type meningococcus survives within PMNs and is able to delay host cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the ΔlctP and ΔperM strains were significantly killed by PMNs, indicating a role for acquisition of both lactate and glutamate for survival in PMNs. Killing was dependent on actin polymerisation and the PMN oxidative burst. The role of the meningococcal Base Excision Repair (BER) DNA repair pathway was also investigated through characterisation of two Apurinic/Apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease paralogues, NExo and NApe. Both exhibit distinct biochemical functions and are required for resistance against oxidative stress. A strain lacking both these enzymes, which is attenuated in vivo, was significantly killed by human PMNs as a result of the oxidative burst.

=520  3\$aIn vitro erythropoiesis of cord blood haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to produce fully enucleated red blood cells could provide an alternate resource for the erythrocyte. However, haematopoietic processes are highly complex and dynamic; defining process requirements to produce reproducible cells of high purity and yield is not an easy task. One major obstacle is the lack of knowledge in process characteristics. Design of experiments (DOE) is proposed as a tool to unveil process complexities that exist in HSC cultures. Characterisation and optimisation of in vitro erythropoiesis as a single-step culture is first performed via a simple DOE experimental strategy. The optimised DOE culture produced significantly better results (higher growth and faster maturation) than other single-step cultures. Subsequently, use of DOE to reveal in vitro process dynamics was attempted. This study was much more challenging and the repeatability of DOE process models was compromised in some cases. Process control of HSC culture bioprocesses is required for the delivery of reliable cell culture products suited for clinical applications. The availability of a convenient and economical online real-time process monitoring system can provide the means to translate stem cell culture bioprocesses from the bench-side into manufacturing production. The design and integration of such a system capable of simultaneous process monitoring of multiple analytes (ammonia, pH and oxygen) is presented. Operational and functional stability of this unique online real-time in situ monitoring platform was achieved. Stability of oxygen and ammonia sensors was achieved for up to three and six days respectively but biocompatibilities of both sensors require some improvements. Sensors of pH were biocompatible but their stability in cell culture is required.

=520  3\$aMSCs have great therapeutic potential and are currently used in various clinical trials. However, the extremely low frequency of MSCs and the absence of a known cell-specific marker have made their purification and identification a highly challenging goal. Our hypothesis is that identification of a MSC specific cell surface marker would facilitate isolation of a pure population of MSCs, which in clinical studies may enhance the subsequent regenerative effect in comparison to a heterogeneous MSC population. Our aim therefore was to attempt to identify such MSC-specific markers using a transcriptomics approach. Individual clones were isolated after seeding bone marrow mononuclear cells from BALB/b and BALB/c mice in 5% oxygen tension. All clones had the ability to differentiate into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts, and to self-renew, and were therefore functionally characterised as MSCs. All murine MSC clones consistently expressed very high levels of Sca-1. Cytogenetic analysis of clones revealed an abnormal karyotype of 69 chromosomes and transplantation of cells into immuno-compromised SCID mice revealed no evidence of tumour formation after 7 months indicating that cells were not malignant. A rigorous genome-wide supervised microarray analysis revealed six genes were differentially expressed on the MSC clones in comparison to various controls - STEAP1, STEAP2, ly6f, versican, vitamin D receptor, and H2-M9. Two-dimensional hierarchical clustering of 28 different arrays revealed both STEAP genes and vitamin D receptor also had a similar expression pattern to Sca-1. Thus STEAP1 and STEAP2 were the only two cell membrane protein encoding genes identified by both analysis methods. Importantly, flow cytometry analysis revealed STEAP2 was differentially expressed in normal diploid multipotent human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) compared to fibroblasts and freshly isolated bone marrow cells. Furthermore, western blot analysis revealed STEAP1 was significantly expressed in hBMSCs, but not by human fibroblasts or human chondrocytes. STEAP1 depletion by RNA interference resulted in decreased cell adherence to tissue culture plastic. Results suggest STEAP1 and STEAP2 may be novel MSC markers in murine and in human cells. Further work is needed to elucidate their role in MSCs and to establish their usefulness as potential cell-specific markers.

=520  3\$aPhosphodiesterases (PDEs) play a key role in the control of cardiac contraction. PDE inhibitors are associated with cardiotoxicity, and increased knowledge of cardiomyocyte PDEs is required for improved pharmaceutical development. PDE activity and function were compared in animal and human cardiomyocytes in order to determine a suitable model for the human response, and to generate new insights into the role of cardiomyocyte PDEs. Ventricular myocytes were isolated from rat, guinea pig and diseased human heart. PDE gene expression was measured using RTPCR; PDE activity was measured using a scintillation proximity assay and isoform-specific PDE inhibitors. Effects of PDE inhibition on cardiomyocyte contractility were measured using electrically paced isolated cells. The human cardiomyocyte PDE expression and activity profile was closer to the guinea pig than the rat. High levels of PDE1 activity against cAMP and lower levels of possible PDE5 activity were found in guinea pig and human cardiomyocytes, but not rat. Non-specific PDE inhibition increased basal cardiomyocyte percentage shortening in cells from all three species; PDE3 inhibition only increased percentage shortening in guinea pig and human cardiomyocytes; PDE4 inhibition did not affect basal percentage shortening in cardiomyocytes from any of the three species. Further studies using rat cardiomyocytes found that PDE3 and PDE4 inhibition both significantly increased percentage shortening when cAMP levels were raised; rat β1- and β2- adrenergic receptors were also differentially regulated by PDE3 and PDE4. The functional effects of PDE1 inhibition were investigated in guinea pig cardiomyocytes but no significant effects were measured. Dual PDE1/PDE5 inhibition was shown to have a small negative effect on isoprenaline-stimulated contractility in rat, guinea pig and human cardiomyocytes. This study has revealed new insights into cardiomyocyte PDEs and demonstrated that the guinea pig may be a more suitable model for diseased human cardiomyocytes than the rat.

=520  3\$aNeural stem cell grafts can potentially repair damage or degeneration of the human central nervous system (CNS). However, the only neural cells reported to provide any benefit to date have been immature neural precursors derived from aborted foetuses. Recent studies suggest that neural cells can be derived from non-neural and non-embryonic tissues such as bone marrow, peripheral and umbilical cord blood, and umbilical cord matrix (Wharton's jelly). These tissues may therefore represent a more accessible source of cells for therapeutic repair and regeneration of the brain and spinal cord. Furthermore, they could potentially be obtained and grafted autologously, thereby reducing the risk of tissue rejection. At present, little is known about the origin, frequency and phenotypic characteristics of stem cells from the umbilical cord matrix. The aim of this study was to characterise and analyse the neurogenic potential of a potentially novel source of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the Wharton's jelly (WJ) of human umbilical cord, and compared to foetal blood-derived MSCs. Cell division rates determined by serial passaging and CyQuant proliferation assay, senescence, antigenic profiles, and mesodermal (osteogenic and adipogenic) or neural differentiation potentials were assessed. MSCs from both sources showed typical fibroblastic morphology and formed monolayers in culture with foetal bovine serum (FBS). Most WJ (more than 82%) MSCs expressed characteristic markers, including CD105 (SH2), CD73 (SH3), prolyl-4 hydroxylase (5B5) and vimentin (V9). The doubling times of the foetal blood MSCs and WJ cells were 30 and 36 hours, respectively. Furthermore, WJ and foetal blood MSCs demonstrated osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential in vitro. The neural differentiation potential of these cells in a range of culture conditions was assessed with varying results.

=520  3\$aLaser-plasma interactions have many potential applications, such as medical treatments,x-ray generation, particle acceleration and inertial confinement fusion (ICF).In all of these applications, understanding how laser energy is absorbed by the materialand converted into energetic electrons is very important. Therefore it is vitalto enhance the understanding of how these energetic electrons are created and whatmechanisms influence them. This Thesis comprises experimental studies of electron acceleration mechanismsin laser-plasma interactions, as well as simulations relevant to these experiments. The experiments described were conducted at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratoryutilising the VULCAN laser facility, and investigate laser interactions with both underdenseand overdense plasmas. In the underdense regime, the intensity dependence of the accelerated electronshas been studied experimentally, as well as the impact of the focusing geometry onthe generation of hot electrons. For high intensities, experimental measurementsshow a scaling of the temperature of the electrons with a0. Density and f-numberdependencies of the accelerated electrons are also observed. The effect of laser polarisation and target thickness on the escaping electronsis studied for laser interactions with solid targets, or overdense plasmas. It wasfound that the effective temperature of the electrons depends on both the laserpolarisation and the target thickness. The electron production from ultra-thin foils,and the effect of laser pre-pulse are also investigated.

=520  3\$aThis thesis is a study of material blends involving organic semiconductors and their applicationto opto-electronic devices, particularly photovoltaic diodes. Its principal aim is to examinethe microstructure of the blend, where microstructure is defined as molecular ordering andspatial arrangement on the nanometer to micrometer scale. In general, each chapter of thethesis presents a novel means by which to influence the microstructure of organic semiconductorblends. These techniques are used as a means to understand how the photophysics of optoelectronicdevices is influenced by microstructure. We establish some general principles of howmicrostructure relates to device performance and also find high performance in some entirelynovel device structures and architectures. It is hoped that understanding developed here willlead to improvements in the performance of organic photovoltaic devices.

=520  3\$aPore scale network modeling has been used to predict transport flow properties formultiphase flow successfully. The prediction is based on having geologically realisticnetworks that are computationally expensive to generate and normally represent onlya very small section of the rock sample. We present a new method to generatestochastic random networks representing the pore space of different rocks with giveninput pore and throat size distributions and connectivity ? these distributions can beobtained from an analysis of pore-space images. The stochastic networks can bearbitrarily large and hence are not limited by the size of the original image. The basic assumption made in the prediction of transport flow properties using mostpore-scale models is that the flow is capillary dominated. This implies that the viscouspressure drop is insignificant compared to the capillary pressure. However, at the fieldscale, gravity and viscous forces dominate displacement processes. We develop arate-dependent network model that accounts for viscous forces by solving for thewetting and non-wetting phase pressure and which allows wetting layer swelling nearan advancing flood front. We propose a new time-dependent algorithm by accountingfor partial filling of elements. We use the model to study the effects of capillary number and mobility ratio onimbibition displacement patterns, saturation and velocity profiles. We also investigatethe effects of capillary number and mobility ratio on the water fractional flow curve,cumulative oil production and residual oil saturation for water-wet and mixed-wetsystems. By using large networks we reproduce Buckley-Leverett profiles directlyfrom pore-scale modeling thereby providing a bridge between pore-scale and macroscaletransport.

=520  3\$aNuclear receptors, including the pregnane x receptor (PXR) and the farnesoid x receptor (FXR), regulate the expression of genes that maintain bile acid (BA) homeostasis. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a common gestational liver disease and BAs are implicated in its pathogenesis. Rodents exhibit maternal liver growth in order to meet the metabolic demands of pregnancy. This process is found to precede changes in body weight, occur in the presence of raised serum BAs and is likely to be driven by a placental lactogen. While the growth is normally achieved by hepatocyte hypertrophy, potentially harmful hyperplasia makes a major contribution in mice lacking Fxr. Consistent with reports of raised serum BAs in normal pregnant women, hepatic BAs are found in association with pro-cholestatic gene expression in normal pregnant mice. Gestation could be a state of reduced Fxr function because BA-fed and Fxr-/- mice do not develop raised hepatic BAs during pregnancy. Sequencing and functional assessment of PXR variants revealed that polymorphisms in this gene are unlikely to contribute to the aetiology of ICP. Surprisingly, Pxr-/- mice have enhanced hepatic metabolism and are resistant to toxicity caused by lithocholic acid (LCA). Furthermore, while hepatic Pxr is activated by intraperitoneal injection of LCA, it is not activated by physiologically relevant LCA-feeding. Summary: Pregnancy causes liver growth, raised hepatic BA and pro-cholestatic gene expression in normal mice. In humans, these adaptations may expose predisposed individuals to gestational liver disease. Genetic variation in PXR does not contribute to ICP and Pxr may play only a limited role in mediating hepatic responses to toxic BAs.

=520  3\$aEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) establishes a latent infection in the human host. In order to produce infectious virus particles EBV must reactivate from latency and enter its lytic cycle. BZLF1 is the immediate early gene in EBV that mediates the switch between latency and the lytic cycle. The BZLF1 gene is under the control of the Zp promoter. Reactivation from latency is studied in EBV positive Akata cell lines where EBV can be reactivated by crosslinking the B-cell receptor (BCR) using antibodies to mimic antigen binding. This system uses stably transfected reporter plasmids to study Zp regulation. Mutagenesis identified additional regions of the promoter that contribute to regulation and the ZID MEF2 binding site was demonstrated to be functionally important during the initial stages of Zp activation. XBP-1 splicing, previously implicated in Zp reactivation, was found to occur rapidly in this system in response to BCR crosslinking and parallels the transient induction of Zp. Chromatin remodelling also plays an important role in Zp regulation. An inducible BZLF1 expression system, independent of BCR signalling, was developed in Akata cells that accurately mimics BZLF1 activity and provides a novel approach to study repression at Zp. The BZLF1 protein is related to the bZIP family of transcription factors. BZLF1 contains a bZIP motif in which C-terminal residues fold back against a zipper region that forms an a-helical coiled-coil. The 208SSENDRLR215 sequence in the zipper region is conserved between BZLF1 and C/EBP. Point mutagenesis in this sequence revealed the importance of individual residues for transactivation and progression to DNA replication. The restoration of BZLF1 DNA replication activity by complementation of two deleterious mutations (S208E and D236K) indicated that the interaction of the C-terminal tail and the core zipper region is required for DNA replication, identifying a functional role for this structural feature unique to BZLF1.

=520  3\$aHabitat loss at the hands of human enterprise continues to drive the global decline inbiodiversity. While much attention has been placed on the use of protected areas as ameans of conservation, there is an increasing need to understand the capacity ofunprotected, human-altered landscapes to provide refugia and connectivity at largerspatial scales. This study evaluates the mammalian diversity that persists underalternative land management regimes and degrees of landscape change in south-centralSumatra, Indonesia. Species occurrence data compiled from extensive field surveysacross 1600km2 form the basis for analyses of community composition and speciesspecificresponses to the current landscape. Results indicate that species richnessdeclined with increased landscape alteration. The lowest observed species numberswere in areas of industrial scale oil palm production rather than scrub habitats ordegraded forest. Endangered mammals that persisted in the wider matrix were extirpatedfrom the oil palm dominated areas. Comparisons between the ecological traits shared bypersistent versus locally extirpated species revealed that in the initial stages of landscapechange there is the capacity to support large specialist species with slow life histories. Aslandscape degradation continues to an agricultural matrix only habitat and dietgeneralists persisted. Tests of species-specific responses to landscape alteration focussed on the occurrencepatterns of Sumatran tigers (Panthera tigris sumatrae) and four principal prey species. Measures of human prevalence derived from survey data and a novel application ofoccupancy estimation techniques, identified significant negative responses to higherlevels of landscape development. Satellite derived measures of habitat connectivity andlocalised landcover degradation found that connectivity to areas of least disturbed forestwas more important for reclusive species such as tapir (Tapirus indicus) and red muntjac(Muntiacus muntjak), while the occurrence of the wide-ranging tiger was more stronglyinfluenced by local landcover degradation. The capacity of human altered landscapes tocontribute to the conservation of mammalian communities is closely allied to theavailability of degraded forests rather than alternative human altered landcovers. Giventhat these areas of forest are increasingly subject to degradation and conversion, spatialplanning and proactive management are required to safeguard these resources.

The aim of this thesis is toinvestigate different models and propose a perceptually-relevant reverberation model with suitableparameter estimation techniques for different applications. Reverberation can be modelled in both the time and frequency domain. The model parametersgive direct information of both physical and perceptual characteristics. These characteristicscreate a multidimensional parameter space of reverberation, which can be to a large extent capturedby a time-frequency domain model. In this thesis, the relationship between physical and perceptualmodel parameters will be discussed. In the first application, an intrusive technique is proposed tomeasure the reverberation or reverberance, perception of reverberation and the colouration. Theroom decay rate parameter is of particular interest. In practical applications, a blind estimate of the decay rate of acoustic energy in a roomis required. A statistical model for the distribution of the decay rate of the reverberant signalnamed the eagleMax distribution is proposed. The eagleMax distribution describes the reverberantspeech decay rates as a random variable that is the maximum of the room decay rates and anechoicspeech decay rates. Three methods were developed to estimate the mean room decay rate fromthe eagleMax distributions alone. The estimated room decay rates form a reverberation model thatwill be discussed in the context of room acoustic measurements, speech dereverberation and robustautomatic speech recognition individually.

=520  3\$aCarbon dioxide (CO2) capture and geological storage (CCS) is recognised as one of themain options in the portfolio of greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation technologies beingdeveloped worldwide. The CO2 capture and storage technologies require significantamounts of energy during their implementation and also change the environmentalprofile of power generation. The holistic perspective offered by Life Cycle Assessment(LCA) enables decision makers to quantify the trade-offs inherent in any change to thepower production systems and helps to ensure that a reduction in GHG emissions doesnot result in significant increases in other environmental impacts. Early LCA studies ofpower generation with CCS report a wide range of results, as they focus on specific CO2capture cases only. Furthermore, previous work and commercial LCA software have arigid approach to system boundaries and do not recognise the importance of the level ofdetail that should be included in the Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) data. This research developed a complete LCA framework for the ?cradle-to-grave?assessment of alternative CCS technologies in carbon-containing fuel power generation. A comprehensive and quantitative Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) database, which modelsinputs/outputs of processes at high level of detail, accounts for technical and geographicdifferences, generates LCI data in a consistent and transparent manner was developedand arranged and flexible structure. The developed LCI models were successfully applied to power plants with alternativepost-combustion chemical absorption capture and oxy-fuel combustion capture. Theresults demonstrate that most environmental impacts come from power generation withCCS and the upstream process of coal production at a life-cycle perspective. LCAresults are sensitive to the type of coal used and the CO2 capture options chosen. Moreover, the models developed successfully trace the fate of elements (including tracemetals) of concern throughout the power generation, CO2 capture, transport andinjection chain. Monte Carlo simulation method combined with the LCI models wasapplied to quantify the uncertainty of emissions of concern. A novel analytical framework for the LCA of CO2 storage was also developed andapplied to a saline aquifer storage field case. The potential CO2 leakage rates werequantified and the operational and geological parameters that determine the ratio of CO2leakage total volume of CO2 injected were identified.

=520  3\$aMost turbulence studies up to the present are based on statistical modeling, however,the spatio-temporal flow structure of the turbulence is still largely unexplored. Tur-bulence has been established to have a multi-scale instantaneous streamline structurewhich influences the energy spectrum and other properties such as dissipation andmixing. In an attempt to further understand the fundamental nature of turbulence and itsconsequences for efficient mixing, a new class of flows, so called ?turbulent-like?, is in-troduced and its spatio-temporal structure of the flows characterised. These flows aregenerated in the laboratory using a shallow layer of brine and controlled by multi-scaleelectromagnetic forces resulting from a combination of electric current and a magneticfield created by a fractal permanent magnet distribution. These flows are laminar, yetturbulent-like, in that they have multi-scale streamline topology in the shape of ?cat?seyes? within ?cat?s eyes? (or 8?s within 8?s) similar to the known schematic streamlinestructure of two-dimensional turbulence. Unsteadiness is introduced to the flows bymeans of time-dependent electrical current. Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) measurements are performed. The techniquedeveloped provides highly resolved Eulerian velocity fields in space and time. Theanalysis focuses on the impact of the forcing frequency, mean intensity and amplitudeon various Eulerian and Lagrangian properties of the flows e.g. energy spectrum andfluid element dispersion statistics. Other statistics such as the integral length and timescales are also extracted to characterise the unsteady multi-scale flows. The research outcome provides the analysis of laboratory generated unsteady multi-scale flows which are a tool for the controlled study of complex flow properties relatedto turbulence and mixing with potential applications as efficient mixers as well as ingeophysical, environmental and industrial fields.

=520  3\$aP2X7 receptors exhibit a mainly non-neuronal localisation on immune and glial cells and primarily function as non-selective cation channels. After prolonged or repeated exposure to agonist, functional and cellular changes occur: the formation of a large diameter pore, cell lysis and the release of mature, biologically active interleukin-1β (IL-1β) a potent inflammatory cytokine. It is this repertoire of functions, along with its localisation that underlies the hypothesis for its involvement in pain processing. The biophysics and pharmacology of rat P2X7 receptors were investigated using stable cell lines. Increases in the current amplitude were shown to be dependent upon the agonist concentration and current deactivation was agonist application number and voltage dependent. These results increased our understanding of the receptor, but have also had implications for the design of protocols to investigate antagonist potency and efficacy. GSK31418A was identified as a potent, reversible and voltage-independent antagonist of rat and human P2X7 receptors. GSK314181A was >10000 fold selective over P2X4 receptors and >1000 fold selective over P2X2/3 receptors. GSK314181A produced a significant reversal of FCA-induced hypersensitivity when profiled in vivo, providing further validation of the role of P2X7 receptors in inflammatory pain. Although the influence of glia cells on neuronal activity in the CNS is now well documented, the role of peripheral glia, Schwann cells and satellite cells of sensory ganglia, is less well established. Non-neuronal cells in DRG cultures were shown to express P2X7 receptors by pharmacological, biophysical and immunofluorescence techniques. Native P2X7 receptors expressed on these cells were shown to have many of the properties of recombinant P2X7 receptors, in regards to the response to agonist activation and pharmacology. Finally, I have shown that Lamotrigine is an effective inhibitor of recombinant rat and human P2X7 receptors and native P2X7 receptors expressed in DRG. The potent inhibition of human P2X7 by Lamotrigine was replicated with the chemical analogue and neuroprotective agent Sipatrigine. However, little effect was recorded for a P2X7 antagonist in two models of epileptiform activity studies.

=520  3\$aMultiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, using antenna arrays at bothreceiver and transmitter, have shown great potential to provide high bandwidthutilization efficiency. Unlike other reported research on MIMO systems whichoften assumes independent antennas, in this thesis an arrayed MIMO systemframework is proposed, which provides a richer description of the channel charac-teristics and additional degrees of freedom in designing communication systems. Firstly, the spatial correlated MIMO system is studied as an array-to-arraysystem with each array (Tx or Rx) having predefined constrained aperture. TheMIMO system is completely characterized by its transmit and receive array man-ifolds and a new spatial correlation model other than Kronecker-based model isproposed. As this model is based on array manifolds, it enables the study of theeffect of array geometry on the capacity of correlated MIMO channels. Secondly, to generalize the proposed arrayed MIMO model to a frequencyselective fading scenario, the framework of uplink MIMO DS-CDMA (Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access) systems is developed. DOD estimationis developed based on transmit beamrotation. A subspace-based joint DOA/TOAestimation scheme as well as various spatial temporal reception algorithms is alsoproposed. Finally, the downlink MIMO-CDMA systems in multiple-access multipath fading channels are investigated. Linear precoder and decoder optimization problemsare studied under different criterions. Optimization approaches with differentpower allocation schemes are investigated. Sub-optimization approaches withclose-form solution and thus less computation complexity are also proposed.

The review concentrates on methods that have been usedto form a range of phenols and is divided up according to the type of chemistry employed. The secondchapter describes the development of a novel route to phenols. Initial optimisation results are describedfirst, followed by the synthesis of a library of phenols. The majority of these have not been reportedpreviously. The attempted extension of this work to the formation of anilines, nitrobenzenes and morehighly oxygenated aromatics is also presented. Finally, work towards the synthesis of the aglycone ofpseudopterosin A is described, following a route that would utilise the phenol-forming chemistry in amore complex natural product environment. The final section details the experimental procedures usedto form the compounds described in section two, along with associated spectroscopic data.

=520  3\$aSimple models of competition for one and two resources have been wellinvestigated for both nitrogen and water. Ecosystem models of nitrogen andwater, including their interactions are also well known, but competition andecosystem processes have rarely been considered together. Using a simpleecosystem model of the nitrogen and water cycles including the dependenceof the nitrogen cycle on soil moisture I examine the outcome of competitionfor nitrogen. This model shows that when there are species specific effectson soil moisture, the competitive outcome for nitrogen can be coexistenceor alternative stable states. The last century has seen widespread invasion of Californian grasslands byannual grasses and forbs from the southern Mediterranean region. Both nitrogenand water have been shown to be limiting in this system. The nativeperennial grasses deplete the soil moisture and nitrogen to a lower levelthan the invasive annual grasses, suggesting that natives should be bettercompetitors. Parameterising my model for a Californian grassland systemI show that in fact the invasive annual grasses are the superior competitorfor nitrogen at lower soil moisture when nitrogen competition is mediatedby soil moisture. The competitive outcome at current rainfall levels in Californiais limited to competitive exclusion by the annuals or coexistence. Climate change caused by anthropogenic emissions of CO2 is already affectingcommunities and ecosystems. Global climate models predict changes inboth mean amount and distribution of precipitation. I investigate the effectof changing precipitation distributions on both ecosystem and communityprocesses in nitrogen limited systems. There is wide variation in ecosystemresponse to increased variation in rainfall. The outcome of N competitionwas more predictable, with the best competitor at lower soil moisture beingconsistently favoured with increasing rainfall variability. This might proveanother problem in restoring native grasses in Californian grasslands.

=520  3\$aOrganic devices based on polymer:fullerene blend films are attracting extensiveinterest as low cost solar cells, with power conversion efficiencies over 5%.Improvements in performance are dependent on developing a better understanding ofthe pertinent loss processes. This in turn requires the ability to reliably determinecharge densities (n) and carrier lifetimes (?n) in real devices under standard operatingconditions. In this thesis, we address the recombination dynamics in organic solarcells based on blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and methanofullerene [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), P3HT:PCBM devices, one of the bestdevices to date, using both experimental and modelling studies. Initially, a drift-diffusion model was used to study the basic principles of solar celloperation, with particular focus on investigating the ?corrected photocurrent?, wherethe effects of dark injection are removed. We then have employed a series ofexperimental techniques ? including transient photovoltage and photocurrent,transient absorption spectroscopy and charge extraction ? to determine the carrierlifetimes and charge densities in standard annealed P3HT:PCBM devices underoperation. The results of our studies for a device under open-circuit conditions showthat the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is primarily governed by a trap dependentbimolecular recombination process. By applying charge extraction studies on devicesunder forward bias in the dark, we show that the dark current is also governed by thesame trap dependent bimolecular recombination mechanism which determines Voc. Based on the understanding of charge carrier dynamics at Voc and the forward biasdark current, a simple model has been developed to simulate ?light? current-voltage(J-V) curves. Despite the simplicity of this model, remarkably good agreement wasobserved with experimental J-V data.

=520  3\$aSeismology is arguably the most powerful technique for probing the interior of planetary bodies. On the Sun, this is a relatively new field (helioseismology), in which cross-correlation is used to extract coherent signals from random seismic noise. Here, I test the validity of the cross-correlation technique. The structure of the cross-correlated signal is only marginally different from the uncorrelated signal of a single source. However, large amounts of data must be averaged in order to produce a clear signal. A comparison of travel-time tomography utilising the cross-correlation approach, with wave field tomography, which need not require cross-correlation of data, indicates that structures can be imaged to higher resolution - both spatially and quantitatively - using the latter approach. On the Earth, extensive seismic imaging has already been done, and we move towards interpretation of seismic structure in terms of temperature and composition. Deviations from a radially-symmetric spherical structure amount to only a few percent. However, even for this background structure, thermochemical interpretation is debated. Here, I test, for the mantle between 250 and 2500 km depth, the compatibility of potential 1-D thermochemical structures, with a range of seismic data. Furthermore, I account for the large uncertainties in the conversion from thermo-chemical to seismic structure, using a thermodynamic approach that determines phase relations, elastic parameters, density and anelasticity. In the upper mantle, the data require significant change in average chemical composition with depth, most likely due to 3-D chemical heterogeneity, especially around 660 km. In the lower mantle, clarification of the values of temperature and pressure derivatives of the mineral elastic moduli would be necessary to constrain tightly the average thermochemical structure. A superadiabatic temperature gradient, plus a change in composition with depth, may provide a better fit to the data than the commonly-assumed homogeneous, adiabatic pyrolite profile.

=520  3\$aTranscutaneous immunisation (TCI) is a novel needle-free method of vaccine delivery, which involves the application of soluble antigens onto the surface of intact skin. In this thesis, the immunogenicity and neutralising potency of tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) fragments were compared to that of tetanus toxoid (TTxd) following TCI. In addition, to understand the mechanisms of induction of immune response by TCI, in vitro and in vivo interaction of tetanus proteins with skin immune cells was also investigated. The 50kDa recombinant carboxyl-terminal fragment of tetanus toxin (HCWT) and a 50kDa HC mutant(HCM115) which is devoid of neuronal binding properties, were expressed and purified by affinity chromatography, and excess endotoxin removed by size exclusion chromatography. Mice immunized with HCWT, in the absence of adjuvant, induced the highest anti-toxoid and anti-HCWT antibody titers, with significant increases in the toxin neutralising antibody response when compared with TTxd. In vitro studies demonstrated that both HC fragments and TTxd were capable of up regulating the surface expression of activation marker ICAM-1 on murine bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (DC), but not on the human keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RealtimeRT-PCR) analysis showed that TNF-α expression was up regulated in vivo as early as 10 minutes following TCI, and this was caused by shaving rather than by tetanus proteins themselves. Immunohistochemistry staining to monitor the translocation of HCWT fragment and TTxd through the skin following TCI showed that HCWT protein could be detected in both the epidermis and dermis within four hours post-application. However, TTxd translocation appeared to be much slower in comparison. Collectively, the results presented in this thesis suggest that TCI may provide an opportunity for effective delivery of toxin-like antigens, which harbor protective epitopes and that traditional toxoid proteins may not be optimal antigens for skin immunisation.

=520  3\$aA genome threading algorithm was employed by Inpharmatica to identify a number of proteins with a predicted structure similar to that of the ligand binding domain (LBD) of nuclear receptors (NRs), an approach that has been successfully used to annotate the yeast transcription factor Oaf1 (Phelps et al, 2006). This work focuses on one such protein termed NR3, which is identical to TRPC4AP or TRUSS, a protein proposed to function as a scaffold protein in cell signalling processes and as a cell cycle regulator. It is conceivable that NR3 does not function as a transcription factor in contrast to bona fide NRs and that the putative LBD may function as an allosteric switch to control functional activity. To investigate the idea that NR3 may possess a fold similar to the LBD of NRs preliminary structural work has been undertaken, which has suggested the putative LBD folds into an autonomous domain as it is region resistant to proteolysis. In addition, the potential role of the putative LBD fold as a molecular switch was examined by using constitutively active fusion proteins in reporter gene assays. It was determined that the putative NR3 LBD acts in a repressive manner, potentially due to the alteration in subcellular localisation exerted by the putative NR3 LBD on the fusion protein. To further assess the role of the putative LBD a ligand screen was undertaken to identify compounds that may reduce its repressive activity, however no ligand was identified and it is conceivable NR3 may act in a ligand independent manner similar to some orphan receptors. Initial analysis of NR3 function indicates that its expression may have a positive effect on cell proliferation. To further assess the role of NR3 protein interaction assays were established to screen for binding partners. This identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase component DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1) as an interacting protein involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression and DNA repair. Mapping studies suggest NR3 binds to the substrate docking site of DDB1 and further analysis showed NR3 to be ubiquitinated, affecting the stability of the protein. It is reported that the arylhydrocarbon receptor binds to a DDB1 complex, which then acts as a ligand regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Ohtake et al, 2007). This raises the possibility that NR3 may act in functionally analogous manner. To address NR3 function within the whole organism a targeting vector designed to inactivate the NR3 gene has been generated and currently a conditional knockout mouse line are being bred.

=520  3\$aA three dimensional, coupled computational fluid dynamics and finite element model of a single, anode supported solid oxide fuel cell has been developed in order to predict the probability of failure of the ceramic components subjected to an idealised operating duty cycle. The duty cycle represents cooling from sintering, warming to a uniform temperature of 800°C where anode chemical reduction takes place, operation at low, medium and high power and finally cooling to room temperature. The Star CDTM computational fluid dynamics code provided the platform to determine the temperature distribution throughout the operating fuel cell by solving the conservation equations for energy, mass and momentum, with additional subroutines written to account for species transport, electrochemical reactions and heat generation. An Abaqus™ finite element model used the temperature distribution predicted by the computational fluid dynamics model at low, medium and high power to solve for the thermal stress distribution for individual cases and throughout the duty cycle. The finite element model included the effects of thermal expansion, residual stress from manufacture, material properties changes due to chemical reduction of the anode and viscoplastic creep. The maximum principal stress in the anode support layer at 800°C and low, medium and high power was found to be 5.0, 26.5, 33.2 and 39.8 MPa respectively. The stress analysis results were used to determine the time independent and time-dependent (accounting for sub-critical crack growth) probability of failure, and showed that over the duty cycle sub-critical crack growth significantly increased the predicted probability of failure in the anode support layer from less than 1 x 10⁻¹² to 0.54, and in the cathode layer from 1.28 x 10⁻⁵ to 1.24 x 10⁻³. The probability of failure of SOFC ceramic components is thus shown to be both time and history dependent.

=520  3\$aCharacterisation and manipulation of Vaccinia virus (VACV) immunomodulators is important for engineering recombinant VACV vaccines with enhanced immunogenicity. To this end, the goal of this study was to characterise the putative immunomodulator, C16, a protein of interest due to proposed similarity to the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein. C16 is a highly conserved, early protein of approximately 37 kDa that actively shuttles between the cytoplasm and nucleus in transfected and infected cells. In order to study the function of C16, a VACV mutant lacking the C16L gene (vΔC16) and a revertant virus wherein the gene was reinserted into the deletion mutant (vC16Rev) were constructed. In cell culture, vΔC16 had similar replication kinetics to wild type and revertant control viruses, but formed a smaller plaque. The loss of C16 led to a significantly attenuated phenotype in a murine intranasal model of infection that was characterised by reduced weight-loss and signs of illness. While virus titres between the virus sets were comparable in the initial days of infection, virus titres of vΔC16 dropped more rapidly over the course of the infection. In vΔC16-infected mice there was also an accelerated recruitment and activation of lymphocytes. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the murine intradermal model of infection. Furthermore, the omission of C16 did not decrease the efficacy of protective vaccination. The attenuation of vΔC16 in vivo may be due to the effect of C16 on IL-6 production which has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. This is reminiscent of one of the functions of IL-1Ra though the precise mechanism of this downregulation of IL-6 by C16 remains to be determined. C16 also downregulates ISRE-dependent gene expression, via a mechanism independent of STAT1 but which may involve p38 MAPK.

=520  3\$aKinetic processes occurring upstream of planetary bow shocks can greatly perturb the magnetosphere-striking solar wind. Collisionless shocks are highly non-linear systems with complicated feedback mechanisms. Transient events form part of the growing evidence that shocks are highly variable and far more complex than a large-scale quasi-static picture would suggest. In this thesis we survey Cluster magnetic field, thermal ion, and energetic particle observations upstream of Earth's bow shock to investigate events known as foreshock cavities. Foreshock cavities exhibit depressions in magnetic field magnitude and thermal ion density, associated with enhanced fluxes of energetic ions. Two models of foreshock cavity formation exist and we attempt to discriminate between them. Cavities are found in all parts of the Cluster orbit upstream of the bow shock but preferentially in fast, moderate magnetic field strength solar wind streams. Localising foreshock cavity observations in a coordinate system organised by physical processes in the foreshock, reveals a systematic change in foreshock cavity location with the cone angle between the solar wind flow and magnetic field. At low (high) cone angles foreshock cavities are observed outside (inside) the expected boundary of the intermediate ion foreshock. This result favours a model of foreshock cavities as isolated bundles of magnetic flux preferentially filled with energetic particles. We present a case study locating an isolated foreshock cavity precisely with respect to measured bow shock position. We use Cluster's multispacecraft nature to constrain the cavity extent. Associated particle populations are studied in detail. A second case study is shown to coincide with a transition from the deep ion foreshock to the electron foreshock. This event has some features expected from the new model of cavities as brief encounters with a spatial boundary in the global foreshock. Finally, we present the first observations of explosive events resembling Hot Flow Anomalies near Saturn's bow shock.

=520  3\$aDieback disease caused by Fusarium and Lasiodiplodia species is a major threat to cocoa production in Ghana and elsewhere in West Africa. Current recommendations involve insecticide application to control mirid bugs whose feeding punctures provide entry points for these fungi. Little is known about the true identity of the causal pathogens of this disease. Earlier work implicated F. decemcellulare as the causal agent and more rarely L. theobromae (Cotterell, 1927; Crowdy, 1947). A total of 117 single spore fungal cultures was established from diseased cocoa stems imported from Ghana. On morphological grounds cultures could be designated as either Fusarium or Lasiodiplodia spp. The Fusarium cultures exhibited inter-isolate variability with respect to macroscopic appearance and macro-conidium morphology, suggesting the presence of more than a single species. The isolates were further characterised by PCR amplification and sequencing of the ITS region of rDNA and comparison with authentic reference cultures. Thirty-seven Fusarium isolates were identified to twenty F. chlamydosporum, nine F. solani and four isolates each of F. oxysporum and F. proliferatum. The thirty-six Lasiodiplodia isolates were identified to two species, twenty-seven L. pseudotheobromae and nine L. theobromae. In pathogenicity tests, F.chlamydosporum, F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. solani and L. pseudotheobromae, previously unknown as pathogens of either cocoa or any member of the Malvaceae, caused significant wilting and dieback in Amelonado seedlings similar to that observed in the field. All isolates exhibited optimal growth at 30 °C on PDA. Disease incidence in 29 and 15 cocoa germplasm lines in the laboratory and greenhouse, respectively, showed reproducible differences in their reaction to necrotic lesion and dieback infection. LCTEEN 37/F was one of the most susceptible genotypes. CATIE1000, T85/799 and MXC 67 were the most tolerant and could be used in cocoa breeding programmes for resistance to dieback.

=520  3\$aGenomic imprinting in mammals is the monoallelic expression of genes in a parent-of origin dependent manner. Imprinting can be transient and tissue specific, indicative of its role in specific developmental regimes. Placental specific imprinting has been found to be non-conserved between humans and mice. A new model of human trophoblast, trophoblast stem cells (hTS), differentiated from human embryonic stem (hES) cells, allows analysis of placental specific imprinting during the earliest stages of placentation. The use of cell lines to characterise imprinting in vivo is limited by epigenetic alterations during cell line derivation and culture. hES cells may harbour exceptional dichotomy in epigenotype compared to their in vivo counterpart, the preimplantation embryo, due to their derivation from superovulated embryos during genome-wide epigenetic remodelling. There are very limited options for analysis of imprinting in vivo in human tissue, and the most practical and available resource is human peripheral blood. Imprinted gene expression and in normal healthy blood is currently uncharacterised. Analysis of the Kcnq1/KCNQ1 cluster, which contains six ubiquitous and eight murine placental specific imprinted transcripts, in hTS cells showed that imprinting was not conserved for the placental specific transcripts. In addition, one of the ubiquitously imprinted transcripts was not imprinted in hTS cells or undifferentiated hES cells. Subsequent genome-wide imprinting analysis in undifferentiated hES cells and human fetal mesenchymal stem cells (fMSC), not derived from superovulated conceptions or during genome remodelling, found abnormal biallelic expression of several imprinted genes, to an extent consistent between both types of stem cell. In fMSC, differentially methylated imprinting control regions (ICRs) were unexpectedly normal. In hES cells, however, both hypo- and hypermethylation was detected at several ICRs. Imprinted gene expression following differentiation and expression of pluripotentiality conferring transcription factors were measured to further assess the potential of fMSC. Imprinting did not change following differentiation, however, pluripotency transcription factor expression was almost negligible compared to that in hES cells. Imprinting in peripheral blood was characterised by virtually undetectable expression of most transcripts, biallelic expression of those which could be detected and only a minority of genes remaining imprinted. These findings provide an overview of imprinted gene expression in human stem cells, complimenting previous work on hES cells. Whilst imprinted gene expression is universally disrupted by cell culture, the results suggest that methylation at ICRs may be sensitive to derivation associated specifically with hES cells, as it was normal in the fMSC lines. This lack of correlation between methylation at ICRs and imprinted expression was also mirrored in the hES cells as aberrant methylation patterns were stochastic, and did not correlate with the abnormal imprinted expression. This indicates that the loss of imprinting in cultured cells is caused by an epigenetic mechanism other than aberrant methylation. In peripheral blood, the often biallelic nature of imprinted gene expression limits the use of this tissue as a control, and also of this feature as an indicator of disease. Six of the 36 transcripts analysed remained monoallelic in blood giving them potential as biomarkers, so their imprinting status in disease should be characterised further.

=520  3\$aThe ZEPLIN III liquid xenon dark matter detector is designed to potentially discover the WIMP - a supersymmetric galactic dark matter candidate. This thesis presents experimental results of the ZEPLIN III commissioning studies, in preparation for the first and second underground science runs. Data acquired on the surface, at the Imperial College London laboratories, were used to characterise the instrument's response in terms of light yield (LY) and single photoelectron (SPE) spectra. A zero-field LY was measured as 7.42±0.37phe/keV and 18.12±0.91 phe/keV in dedicated single- and dual-phase high yieldconfigurations, respectively, consistent with Monte Carlo simulations. Mean SPEmeasured pulse areas ranged from 41.78±1.55 Vps to 52.37±1.59 Vps, dependingon the method employed. A 3-D position reconstruction was verified and, significantly,no evidence of a potentially-contaminating background -population wasobserved. This study directly lead to critical development of the DAQ software andhardware configuration. The PMT array was confirmed as responsive and, crucially,the particle discrimination principle was demonstrated. Zero-field LYs of (4.6-4.7)±0.5 phe/keV were recovered from the centre of the chamber, exceeding simulationpredictions. With-field (3.01 kV/cm in the liquid) LYs of (1.2-1.8) ±0.3 phe/keVfrom the liquid scintillation (S1) and an electroluminescence yield (S2) of (98-140)±35 phe/keV from the gas phase were also determined. ZEPLIN III was deployed in the Boulby Underground Laboratory, UK and demonstratedsuccessful operation at high field (up to 3.79 kV/cm in the liquid), in situ. An alternative Poisson method for obtaining single photoelectron distributions wasdeveloped by the ZEPLIN collaboration. The origin of long- events in surfacedata was investigated and ultimately resolved as an artefact of early versions ofthe data reduction software. An S1 zero-field LY of 4.72±0.10 phe/keV, obtainedwith a 57Co external source, was recovered for the centre of the chamber. The instrument's energy resolution was evaluated and a novel parameterisation approach,developed by the author, yielded σ=1.08±0.06p E(keV) with a dominant stochastic term. A 'flat-fielding' method was established, proving to minimise the resolution significantly, yielding 8.6% and 7.3% for S1 and S2, respectively, in the fiducialised anti-correlated energy channel. This flat-fielding recipe, along with construction of the light collection correction matrices, formed the basis of the final procedures subsequently applied to first science run data-sets.

Fertiliser is an important component of all agriculturalsystems and can affect the performance of crop pests and their natural enemies. Thisthesis presents the results from a quantitative review of the literature on both farmingsystem and organic and conventional fertiliser effects on pests and natural enemies. Results from a series of laboratory and field experiments investigating the effectsorganic and conventional fertiliser on cereal aphids and their natural enemies arereported. The review demonstrates that crop pests and their natural enemies benefit fromorganic or low intensity methods and this is evident for natural enemies in farm scaleexperiments. The effect of organic and conventional fertilisers on arthropod pests isvariable although the influence of manures is consistently negative while the effect ofplant composts is positive. More studies investigating organic and conventionalfertilisers and the response of natural enemies are needed. Field and laboratory experiments show that conventional fertilisers can benefit cerealaphids but the mechanism behind this response is species specific. Rhopalosiphumpadi is sensitive to temporal nutrients availability and is influenced by the timing offertiliser application, while Metopolophium dirhodum is responsive to plantmorphology with aphids performing better on plants with a high proportion ofvegetative matter. The implications of pest performance on fertiliser managementstrategies are discussed. Parasitoid abundance in the field was not found to beinfluenced by fertiliser treatment although in the laboratory, indirect effects offertiliser, mediated through its aphid host, were found to affect parasitoid fitness withlarger parasitoids emerging from larger aphids. A positive influence of conventionalfertiliser on syrphid oviposition in the field was also apparent.

=520  3\$aVaccinia virus (VACV) strain Western Reserve gene A40R encodes a type II membrane glycoprotein with a C-type lectin-like domain at the C terminus. The A40 protein is not incorporated into virions, is nonessential for virus replication in cell culture and does not affect virus virulence in a murine intranasal model of infection. However, A40 does affect the outcome of infection in an intradermal infection model in which the virus lacking gene A40R produced smaller lesions and alterations in the host immune response. A40 has amino acid similarity to C-type lectins, such as NKG2A and DC-SIGN. This observation together with its location on the infected cell surface and its ability to bind to the surface of cells of the immune system is consistent with A40 functioning as an immunomodulator. It is possible that A40 might function by mimicking native host lectins or by modulating recognition of VACV-infected cells by cells of the immune system. To investigate the mechanism by which A40 affects the outcome of infection in vivo, a cloning and experimental strategy was devised to search for its ligand(s) and try to determine its structure in collaboration with protein crystallographers. To achieve these goals, the recombinant A40 protein has been produced in E. coli, mammalian cells, and from insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. Bacterially expressed recombinant A40 was used to generate an antibody specific to A40 and this was then purified, characterised and used to further the characterisation of A40. The potential for A40 to interact with a ligand on the surface of another cell was investigated by a cell binding assay using recombinant A40 protein. This protein was produced in a mammalian system and was found to bind to the surface of immune cells but not to epithelial cells. In cytotoxicity assays, the absence or over-expression of A40 was found to modulate the ability of NK cells to kill VACV infected cells.

=520  3\$aThis thesis presents the development of a non-invasive, wireless, low-power, phonocardiographic (PCG) or heart sound sensor platform suitable for long-term monitoring of heart function. The core of this development process involves a study of the feasibility of this conceptual system and the development of a prototype mixed-signals integrated circuit (IC) to form the integral component of the proposed sensor. The feasibility study of the proposed long-term monitoring sensor is divided into two main parts. The first part of the study investigates the technological aspect of the conceptual system, via a system level design. This is to prove the technological or operational feasibility of the system, where the system can be built completely using discrete, off-the-shelf electronics components to satisfy the size, power consumption, battery life and operational requirements of the sensor platform. The second part of the study concentrates on the post-processing of the heart sounds and murmurs or PCG data recorded. This is where a number of different de-noising algorithms are studied and their relative performance compared when applied to a variety of different noisy heart sound signals that would likely be acquired using the proposed sensor in everyday life. This was done to demonstrate the functional feasibility of the proposed system, where the ambient acoustic noise in the recorded PCG data can be effectively suppressed and therefore meaningful analysis of heart function i.e. heart rate, can be performed on the data. After the feasibility of the conceptual system has been demonstrated, the final part of this thesis discusses the synthesis and testing of a 0.35 μm CMOS technology prototype mixed analog-digital integrated circuit (IC) to miniaturise part of this sensor platform outlined in the system level design, conducted in the earlier part of this thesis, to achieve the objective specifications ? in terms of the size and power consumption. A new implementation of the multi-tanh triplet transconductor is introduced to construct a pair of 100 nW analogue 4th order Gm-C signal conditioning filters. Furthermore, a 7 μW digital circuit was designed to drive the analog-to-digital conversion cycle of the Linear Technology LTC1288 ADC and synchronise the ADC's output to generate the Manchester encoded data compatible with the Holt Integrated Circuit HI-15530 Manchester Encoder/Decoder.

=520  3\$aThe bile acid receptor FXR maintains bile acid homeostasis through the dynamic regulation of transporters, detoxification and biosynthesis enzymes. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is caused by disturbance in bile acid homeostasis in predisposed individuals. The first genetic variants in FXR, identified in an ICP population, are investigated in this thesis using in vitro approaches and a functional effect is demonstrated. Reproductive hormones are implicated in the aetiology of ICP but experiments in mice suggest that estrogen and progesterone alone are unlikely to be the cause of gestational cholestasis. Pregnancy increases the metabolic demand on the maternal liver and, in mice, causes maternal hepatomegaly that is associated with pro-cholestatic gene expression and raised serum and hepatic bile acids. Gestational hepatomegaly is characterised in detail for the first time and Fxr is shown to be required to maintain the normal mechanisms driving this process. Furthermore, pro-cholestatic gene expression and the fact that hepatic bile acids do not accumulate in pregnant Fxr-/- or cholate-fed mice suggest that for unknown reasons, gestation could be a period of reduced Fxr function. Conclusions: Pregnancy causes perturbed bile acid homeostasis in mice. This may be a result of Fxr playing a complex role in mediating, or responding to, the metabolic demands of gestation. Furthermore, FXR protects individuals from developing pregnancy-specific cholestatic disease.

=520  3\$aDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most prevalent genetic neuromuscular disorder and affects 1 in 3,500 live male births. Lack of the protein dystrophin in muscle fibres causes permanent muscle damage, is lethal and despite various potential therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring dystrophin expression, has no cure. As DMD affects all skeletal muscles as well as the heart, a systemic treatment would be necessary and in utero stem cell transplantation is a promising way of achieving this. The identification of human fetal mesenchymal stem cells (hfMSC) in early gestation fetal blood offers the prospect of allogeneic or autologous cell therapy, while intrauterine administration would capitalise on ontological opportunities unique to the developing fetus. The aim of the study was to improve hfMSC engraftment and contribution to skeletal muscle fibres following intrauterine transplantation (IUT) in a mouse model of DMD. My project demonstrated that hfMSCs are easily isolated and expandable with the ability to undergo myogenesis in vitro. HfMSCs differentiated into mature myotubes following exposure to galectin-1 conditioned medium, while galectin-1 transduced hfMSCs showed significantly higher expression of myogenic markers compared to non-transduced hfMSCs. Co-culture experiments provided an in vitro model to explore the underlying mechanism for muscle differentiation of hfMSCs following IUT. HfMSCs were able to form chimeric myotubes by fusing with myoblasts isolated from E15 mouse embryos, evidence that they should be able to fuse with developing muscle fibres in vivo. Engraftment and differentiation into muscle fibres of hfMSCs injected intra-peritoneally into E15 mouse embryos in vivo was enhanced by using immunodeficient dystrophic host mice, postnatal muscle injury and additional neonatal hfMSC transplantation following IUT. In conclusion, my thesis supports the use of hfMSC as an attractive source for cell therapy and provides the background for further studies to optimise their engraftment and differentiation to underpin future clinical applications.

=520  3\$aDamage to joints predisposes to osteoarthritis. The mechanism by which injury to cartilage might lead to net matrix loss and cartilage degeneration remains unknown. Following experimental sharp injury to porcine articular cartilage (dissection from, or scoring of the articular surface), our group has previously shown rapid activation of the 3 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in cartilage. Activation of ERK, and probably also p38 MAPK, is due to release of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) from the matrix after injury. However, despite a long search, the cause of JNK activation following sharp injury remains unknown. I investigated the extent and regulation of inflammatory signalling after cartilage injury and whether it was sufficient to cause expression of inflammatory response genes. In this work, I show that a number of intracellular signalling pathways including PI3 kinase and IκB kinase (IKK) (which leads to activation of NFκB) are activated by sharp injury to cartilage. The signalling following injury was sufficient to induce a wide range of inflammatory response mRNAs, including pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, COX-2 and proteinases such as MMP-1 and ADAMTS-4 in a pattern which was not entirely IL-1-like. Pharmacological inhibition experiments suggested that the production by injured cartilage of an inflammatory response gene which could be assayed at the protein level, activin A, was regulated by FGF-mediated pathways (ERK) as well as by NFκB and tyrosine kinases (src family kinases). Given these findings, the role of tyrosine kinases in the early response of cartilage to injury was explored. By phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation and purification from injured cartilage lysates, FAK and its substrate paxillin were identified from silverstained gels by mass spectrometry. The phosphorylation of these src substrates accounted for rapidly inducible bands seen on phosphotyrosine western blotting of injured cartilage lysates. However, no evidence of a role for src kinases in the regulation of MAPK/IKK signalling upon injury was found. In contrast, blockade of another tyrosine kinase, the FGF receptor, led to partial inhibition not only of the ERK pathway following sharp injury, but also the other MAPKs and IKK. Whilst activation of the same pathways was also seen following injury to synovium, FGF receptor inhibition had no effect on this signalling. This suggested that FGF may have a pro-inflammatory action following injury in vivo which is a particular feature of cartilage.

=520  3\$aSince the terrorist attacks in the USA in September 2001, several regulations have beenintroduced with a special emphasis on the security of containerised port operations. Global security measures specifically targeting container-port operations include theInternational Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) code, the Container SecurityInitiative (CSI), and the 24-hour Advance Vessel Manifest Rule (the 24-hour rule).Nevertheless, no attempt has been made to-date to investigate the ex-post impacts ofsecurity on the operational efficiency of container ports and terminals. This PhDresearch seeks to adopt an approach that incorporates within an analytical frameworkthe association of security with operational efficiency, tools for modelling proceduralsecurity, and techniques for benchmarking container-port efficiency. A panel data set of39 ports and 60 container terminals from 2000 until 2006 is used resulting into 420container-terminal decision-making units (DMUs).In order to account equally for container terminal operational configurations and themulti-input/ multi-output nature of container port production, we apply both processmodelling and analytical benchmarking techniques. These are the Integrated ComputerAided Manufacturing Definition (IDEF0) for operational and security modelling, andData Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for efficiency measurement and benchmarking. Based on the results of IDEF0 modelling, we disaggregate container-port operations byterminal sites (quay, yard and gate) and spatial scope of security and apply alternativeDEA models to analyse (i) the operational impact of individual and aggregate securityregulations and (ii) the influence of operating and exogenous factors on port efficiency. We then estimate a Malmquist productivity index (MPI) to measure and decomposeproductivity changes following the introduction of new security measures. The results of the research confirm that both handling configurations and operatingprocedures have a direct effect on container terminal's productive efficiency. Theanalysis of the impact of security on operational efficiency shows that the latter variesgreatly by security regulation and terminal group but there is evidence of generalisedproductivity gains from the technological progress prompted by investments in the newsecurity technology. More importantly, the implementation of the new port securitymeasures revealed several inherent logistical inefficiencies especially in the wayterminal policies and work procedures are being designed, operated, and managed.

=520  3\$aThe role of coagulation proteins (CPs) in systems other than haemostasis is now recognised. Many of these cellular effects are through protease activated receptors (PARs). This project investigates how CPs influence the adaptive immune response, firstly through the expression of tissue factor (TF) on DCs; secondly through the action of PARs on dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells; and thirdly by examining the direct effect of anti-thrombin (AT) on DCs. This work identified for the first time a subset of mouse DCs that expresses TF. The form of TF changed from cryptic to pro-coagulant as DCs matured. In addition it was found that blocking TF on immature but not mature DCs enhanced their stimulatory capacity, possibly through PAR-2 signalling. In vivo studies supported this finding and suggest that inhibiting TF breaks T cell tolerance. Thrombin enhanced the T cell response through an effect on DCs but not T cells. Both primary and secondary responses increased but there was no change when stimulated T cells were rechallenged with thrombin-incubated DCs. This mechanism was not through changes in MHCII, co-stimulatory molecules or cytokine production. Although DCs expressed PAR, individual PAR-1 or PAR-4 activation did not affect DC stimulatory capacity. Anti-thrombin was found to reduce T cell activation in vivo. When DCs were treated with AT alone there was no change in T cell response, whereas treatment with AT before LPS led to an increase in IL-4 and IL-10 from T cells suggesting induction of tolerance. Anergy and T cell suppressor assays, however, failed to demonstrate a tolerant phenotype. Overall the findings demonstrate that DCs have the ability to generate and respond to CPs and thus influence the T cell response. This work identifies potential new targets in the innate system which may be used to influence the adaptive immune response.

=520  3\$aBehavioural and electrophysiological responses of winged virginoparous Aphis fabae to volatile compounds of faba bean, Vicia faba, were studied and semiochemicals used in host location identified. In olfactometer bioassays, aphids responded positively to V. faba volatiles from an intact plant. This response also occurred when volatiles from an air entrainment sample of a V. faba plant were tested. Coupled gas chromatography-electroantennography revealed the presence of 16 electrophysiologically active volatile compounds in the air entrainment sample and 15 of these were identified as (E)-2-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol, 1-hexanol, benzaldehyde, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, octanal, (Z)-3-hexen-1-yl acetate, (R)-linalool, methyl salicylate, decanal, undecanal, (E)-caryophyllene, (E)-β-farnesene, (S)-germacrene D, and (E,E,)-4,8,12-trimethyl-1,3,7,11-tridecatetraene. A synthetic blend consisting of all identified compounds in the same concentration and ratio as in the air entrainment sample elicited a similar behavioural response from the aphids as the air entrainment sample. Each compound was tested for behavioural activity individually at the same concentration as in the air entrainment sample and subsequently over a range of different doses. It was found that the response to the complete blend was not due to a response to a single compound. Dose response experiments also revealed ten of the compounds elicited negative behavioural responses from aphids. Further behavioural experiments revealed that these responses were context-specific and behavioural activity of individual compounds was different when they were presented alongside other compounds in the blend. It was hypothesised that a blend of host volatiles in a species-specific ratio may be used by A. fabae to recognise its host. To determine whether or not ratios of volatiles could provide a reliable cue to host seeking aphids, intra-specific and diurnal variation of ratios of volatiles emitted were investigated. Although considerable variation in ratios was observed the quantities of some pairs of compounds were positively correlated, indicating a degree of consistency in the ratios.

=520  3\$aThis thesis describes work on the development of new integrated methods for thecharacterisation of porous media. Porous media are of wide importance in a variety ofapplications including oil and gas production, tissue engineering, filtration and separationand ground water hydrology. Such porous media are characterised by the fraction of theirvolume occupied by pores (the porosity) and by parameters characterising the ease of flowand diffusion through the medium (the permeability and the diffusivity). However, the flowprocesses are very complex, reflecting the complex nature of the pore structure. The objective of the work described in this thesis was to develop and apply two newintegrated pieces of apparatus which were aimed at elucidating several aspects of thecomplex flow processes. The first integrated apparatus was aimed at the study of gaseoustransport and the second at the study of mercury penetration, flow and electrical conduction,in the pores of selected media. Thin-section imaging was also applied to obtainsupplementary information. The integrated gaseous transport apparatus was designed not only to measure permeability(by the pressure rise technique), but also to study both steady state and (importantly)transient diffusion of oxygen in nitrogen in the pores of the selected media. The system wascapable of operating with media with a wide range of permeabilities and yielded accuratevalues of the viscous permeability and the slip flow coefficient. In addition, experiments were carried out in the partially turbulent flow region. The diffusion measurements yieldedinformation on the ratio (rD) of the diffusion coefficient in the media to that in free space; thisratio is also a specific property of the medium. Combining the steady state and transientdiffusion measurements, it was possible to deduce the effective porosity and the pore length. The second integrated apparatus was for the study of porous media subjected to mercurypenetration under pressure. This apparatus allowed conventional mercury porosimetrymeasurements to be performed (i.e. measurements of the pore volume occupied as a functionof pore size penetrated) but, crucially, it also allowed measurements of the permeability tomercury and of the conductivity with mercury to be made simultaneously. The permeabilityto mercury approaches the gaseous value when complete saturation of the medium isachieved; however the manner in which mercury permeability varies with pore size gives astriking indication of the role of the various pores in the flow process. In the conductivityexperiments, the ratio (rCp) of the conductivity of the medium penetrated with mercury atpressure p to the conductivity of pure mercury is determined as a function of p. At highpenetration pressures, the value of rCp approaches that of rD reflecting the analogy betweenconduction and diffusion when the medium is saturated with mercury. However, the variationof rCp with pore size penetrated gives a remarkable indication of the significance of the poresin given size ranges in the diffusion process (analogous to the information yielded by themercury permeability measurements relating to the overall permeability).

=520  3\$aMeasures of current extinction risk imply that a high proportion of the world's species are threatened with global extinction in the near future, stressing the need for thorough understanding of extinction processes. In this thesis, I investigate three aspects of current global species extinction risk, using novel phylogenetic and spatially-explicit comparative methods. First, I develop a new measure of the phylogenetic-signal strength in extinction risk, and use it to show that the non-randomness in global mammalian extinction risk differs with threatening processes. These results imply that the biological traits which increase species' susceptibility depend on the anthropogenic threat experienced. Secondly, I investigate the focus of current extinction risk, both spatially and in terms of biological traits increasing risk. I model regional extinction-risk correlates for mammals across the globe, finding strong geographical variation in the influence of biological traits on risk, and in trait interactions with anthropogenic impacts. I also compare biological and anthropogenic correlates of global extinction risk across and within mammals, birds and frogs. Results from this large-scale comparative study further confirm the strong heterogeneity of extinction processes, with taxon-specific traits playing a relatively large role in determining species' fates. Finally, I estimate possible impacts of current extinction risk using three measures of global mammalian diversity: species richness, phylogenetic diversity and functional diversity. My results show that selective losses of large species will deplete functional variety in mammals, especially in the tropics. Loss of functional diversity is much higher than expected under random species loss, and there is low congruence with losses of species richness and phylogenetic diversity. The selectivity of current extinction risk means that we stand to lose a very biased sample of global diversity, with potentially severe consequences for ecosystem functioning.

=520  3\$aThe flow around two identical circular cylinders, arranged in configurations whereone of the cylinders is immersed in the wake of the other, is studied using numericalsimulations. Two aspects of such flows were considered. The first is the stabilityof nominally two-dimensional time-periodic wakes to three-dimensional perturbations. We investigated flows around tandem and staggered arrangements withdiverse centre-to-centre distances. Direct stability analysis and numerical simulationswere employed, and the results are compared to those obtained for the flowaround an isolated cylinder. The onsets of the three-dimensional instabilities werecalculated and the unstable modes are fully described. In addition, we assess thenonlinear character of the bifurcations and physical mechanisms are proposed toexplain the instabilities. The second aspect considered in this thesis is the flowinducedvibration experienced by a rigid cylinder when it is mounted on an elasticbase and immersed in the wake of a fixed identical cylinder. Tandem arrangementswith centre-to-centre distances varying from 1.5 to 8 cylinder diameters were tested. The flow was simulated using an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach that coupledthe solution of the structure equations with that of the flow. Two- and three- dimensionalsimulations were performed to assess the mutual influence between thethree-dimensional flow structures in the wake and the motion of the cylinder. Theresponse of the downstream cylinder is compared to that of an elastically-mountedrigid isolated cylinder. Based on the simulation results we propose physical mechanismsto explain the origin of the excitation.

=520  3\$aThis thesis is concerned with the description and analysis of a stochastic model for the spread of a directly transmissible infection, leading to permanent immunity after recovery, in a fully susceptible population with a social structure characterised by the presence of households and workplaces. The model considered is highly idealised, but contains the key factors affecting the spread of a directly transmissible infection, namely those environments where frequent and intense contacts are most likely. Important analytical insights include the definition of a novel household reproduction number RH, representing the average number of households infected by a single household, which is shown to overcome some of the limitations of a previously defined reproduction number and the development of a methodology for the approximate computation of the real-time growth rate, which is then used for the estimation of RH from the real-time growth rate. An efficient stochastic simulator is described and is used to gain understanding of the role that local saturation effects within workplaces play in shaping the epidemic spread and to investigate the reliability of estimates of R0 and the average epidemic final size from the real-time growth rate when the presence of the social structure is neglected. The methodologies are applied to the case of pandemic influenza: its relatively low infectiousness suggests that estimation of these key epidemiological quantities is surprisingly accurate when the social structure is neglected and that the additional presence of spatial constraints implying geographically localised transmission has negligible effect on the overall epidemic dynamics. Despite the lack of reliable data concerning workplaces, a realistic range of possible values for RH is identified, but the efficacy of school closure in reducing transmission appears to be difficult to quantify because of the unknown impact it has on transmission in other workplace environments.

=520  3\$aWith an abundance of data resulting from high-throughput technologies, like DNA microarrays,a race has been on the last few years, to determine the structures and functions of genes andtheir products, the proteins. Inference of gene interactions, lies in the core of these efforts. In all this activity, three important research issues have emerged. First, in much of the currentliterature on gene regulatory networks, dependencies among variables in our case genes - areassumed to be linear in nature, when in fact, in real-life scenarios this is seldom the case. This disagreement leads to systematic deviation and biased evaluation. Secondly, althoughthe problem of undersampling, features in every piece of work as one of the major causes forpoor results, in practice it is overlooked and rarely addressed explicitly. Finally, inferenceof network structures, although based on rigid mathematical foundations and computationaloptimizations, often displays poor fitness values and biologically unrealistic link structures, due- to a large extend - to the discovery of pairwise only interactions. In our search for robust, nonlinear measures of dependency, we advocate that mutual informationand related information theoretic functionals (conditional mutual information, totalcorrelation) are possibly the most suitable candidates to capture both linear and nonlinearinteractions between variables, and resolve higher order dependencies. To address these issues, we researched and implemented under a common framework, a selectionnonparametric estimators of mutual information for continuous variables. The focus of theirassessment was, their robustness to the limited sample sizes and their expansibility to higherdimensions - important for the detection of more complex interaction structures. Two differentassessment scenaria were performed, one with simulated data and one with bootstrapping theestimators in state-of-the-art network inference algorithms and monitor their predictive powerand sensitivity. The tests revealed that, in small sample size regimes, there is a significant differencein the performance of different estimators, and naive methods such as uniform binning,gave consistently poor results compared with more sophisticated methods. Finally, a custom, modular mechanism is proposed, for the inference of gene interactions,targeting the identi cation of some of the most common substructures in genetic networks,that we believe will help improve accuracy and predictability scores.

=520  3\$aSchistosoma japonicum, a multi-host parasite, remains highly endemic in China and has recently re-emerged in previously controlled regions. One reason may be, given the current human- and bovine-based control policy, due to a serious lack of knowledge of the potential role for other species of mammals, including dogs, cats and small rodents, in the transmission. This thesis aims to contribute to our understanding of transmission dynamics of S. japonicum by investigating the implications of different reservoirs in the transmission across two contrasting geographical regions/settings: the marshland with the disease persistence versus the hilly region where the disease was once controlled. Longitudinal characterization of S. japonicum infection at both definitive host and intermediate host levels was performed throughout 2006-2007, with the highest prevalence and infection intensity observed in rodents in the hilly region and in the agriculturally important domestic animals (cattle and goats) in the marshland. Three chronobiological trials of cercarial emergence were performed to identify any host (with nocturnal vs diurnal activity)-associated biological traits of the parasite. A late afternoon shedding pattern was observed in the hilly region, compatible with a nocturnal rodent reservoir, and a morning-afternoon dual shedding pattern within marshland areas, consistent with a diurnal bovine major reservoir. Characterization of the parasite population genetic diversity, using microsatellite markers, at both larval stages, also indicated cattle to be the main definitive host reservoir species in the marshland, which was further confirmed by sibling relationship analyses. In the hilly regions, however, epidemiological, biological and molecular data indicated that, in addition to the role of rodents as the main reservoirs to maintain the disease, dogs, with their higher mobility, may also play a significant role in S. japonicum transmission in these areas. The implications of these results, in terms of parasite strain sub-structuring and targeted disease control, were discussed.

=520  3\$aThe importance of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) in several industrial fields has been continuously growing in the last few years with the increasing need for the development of systems able to monitor continuously the integrity of complex structures. In order to be competitive with conventional non-destructive evaluation techniques, SHM must be able to effectively detect the occurrence of damage in the structure, giving information regarding the damage location. Ultrasonic guidedwaves offer the possibility of inspecting large areas of structures from a small number of sensor positions. However, inspection of complex structures is difficult as the reflections from different features overlap. Therefore damage detection becomes an extremely challenging problem and robust signal processing is required in order to resolve strongly overlapping echoes. In our work we have considered at first the possibility of employing a deconvolution approach for enhancing the resolution of ultrasonic time traces and the potential and the limitations of this approach for reliable SHM applications have been shown. The effects of noise on the bandwidth of the typical signals in SHM and the effects of frequency dependent phase shifts are the main detrimental issues that strongly reduce the performance of deconvolution in SHM applications. The second part of this thesis is concerned with the evaluation of a subtraction approach for SHM when changes of environmental conditions are taken into account. Temperature changes result in imperfect subtraction even for an undamaged structure, since temperature changes modify the mechanical properties of the material and therefore the velocity of propagation of ultrasonic guided waves. Compensation techniques have previously been used effectively to overcome temperature effects, in order to reduce the residual in the subtraction. In this work the performance of temperature compensation techniques has been evaluated also in the presence of other detrimental effects, such as liquid loading and different temperature responses of materials in adhesive joints. Numerical simulations and experiments have been conducted and it has been shown that temperature compensation techniques can cope in principle with non temperature effects. It is concluded that subtraction approach represents a promising method for reliable Structural Health Monitoring. Nonetheless the feasibility of a subtraction approach for SHM depends on environmental conditions.

=520  3\$aIn this thesis, the purification, dispersion and separation of Single Walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWNTs) are explored. The motivation for this work arose from the basic desire to understand and further develop the underlying chemistry of SWNTs, thus enabling the extraordinary properties of SWNTs to be used to their full potential. Achieving highly pure SWNT samples on which further chemistry can be undertaken is of critical importance; purification must be able to be performed in a reliable and repeatable manner. As such, a new method of SWNT purification was developed. This method introduced a new base washing step that removed a significant fraction of the impurities created during the standard acid reflux purification. This finding has implications for many existing reports on nanotube chemistry. Separation of SWNTs by their electronic properties is extremely important if SWNTs are to fulfil their potential in a wide range of applications, from optoelectronics to molecular sensing. In order to separate metallic and semiconducting SWNTs, two novel methods were developed, both of which are relatively cheap and easily scalable. First, SWNTs were reduced in liquid ammonia containing an alkali metal. The reduced tube salts were then spontaneously dissolved in dry solvents to form stable dispersions which were found to contain primarily metallic SWNTs; hence, separation was achieved. The second method investigated the separation of SWNTs reduced by electrochemical means. When a voltage was passed through a SWNT sample in a suitable electrolyte, SWNTs were reduced and therefore dissolved. These dissolved SWNTs were deposited as a thin carbon film, in which metallic SWNTs were found to preferentially present; once again, separation was achieved.

=520  3\$aThe primary aim of this thesis was to monitor in vivo intestinal ischemia using rapid sampling on-line microdialysis. A new variant of a clinical assay system was developed for use in gastrointestinal surgery. The assay could process on-line microdialysis samples for glucose and lactate concentrations at 30 second intervals in the concentration range of 25 μM to 30 mM. Intramural human bowel ischaemia was monitored intra-operatively in a clinical collaboration with Prof. Darzi and Prof. Hanna in St. Mary's Hospital, London using a microdialysis probe implantation technique devised by Mr. Samer Deeba. Dialysate levels stabilised within 10-15 minutes following implantation of the CMA 62 microdialysis probe. Clipping of arteries feeding the gastrointestinal tissue to be resected, did not lead to an immediate change in dialysate levels, but a fall in glucose and rise in lactate delayed by 17 ± 2 minutes, n=9. This suggests an additional pool of glucose availability in the bowel, and indicates a possible therapeutic window during bowel surgery. Parallel experimental work was carried out in swine model in the surgical labs of the healthcare company Tyco (Covidien) in Paris. Rapid sampling microdialysis was used to examine the effect of total ischaemia on an anastomosis site. The anastomotic site was devascularised by clamping the mesentery of both sides. Here the tissue reacted to ischaemia immediately, 5 minutes following clamping of feeding artery, compared with a healthy human bowel, suggesting that the additional glucose pool was unavailable in this situation. Physiological variable effects were studied to investigate further any difference with respect to the human in pig bowel physiology, which were not found. The no-net-flux method of in vivo recovery was used to determine the extracellular levels of glucose (0.47 ± 0.05 mM) in the intramural pig bowel. These were substantially lower than blood glucose values, representing a 10% of plasma levels and suggest a difference with human bowel. Finally, 7 patients were monitored after abdominal aortic aneurism repair surgery, for up to 2 days in the intensive care unit, to detect the possible on-set of ischaemia as a complication of inferior mesenteric artery occlusion. Basal microdialysis levels at 3.98 ± 0.75 mM for glucose and 1.38 ± 0.20 mM for lactate agreed well with those measured acutely during surgery, and were not sensitive to changes in plasma values. The lactate/glucose ratio between 1-2 days post-implantation was typically between 0.5-1.0 again similar to the ratio found intra-operatively. This validates the use of microdialysis intra-operatively and confirms the importance of this ratio. An in vivo calibration was performed in one patient with the variable flow rate method providing extracellular levels for glucose (5.8 ± 0.4 mM) and lactate (3.3 ± 0.2 mM) in intramural human bowel. These agree well with measured blood glucose values. Although major ischaemic failure was not seen in these patients, transient ischaemic events lasting 40 minutes and characterised by alactate/glucose ratio increase to 2 were noticed. Finally, a quasi-periodic oscillatory pattern with inverse changes in glucose and lactate was observed during these patients' monitoring. This was ascribed to gut peristalsis.

=520  3\$aThe research described in this thesis concerns the synthesis of transition metal coordinationcomplexes and their activity in the controlled radical polymerisation (CRP) of styrene,methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate. In the first, introductory chapter, the literature pertaining to the main reported CRP systemsis reviewed. The second chapter focuses on a family of novel ?-diimine Fe(II) complexes bearing aconjugated acenaphthene backbone. The ligand-dependent catalytic behaviour in the atomtransfer radical polymerisation (ATRP) of styrene is discussed, and the reaction conditionsare varied to shed light on the system features. In the Chapter 3 the synthesis, characterisation and screening for reverse ATRP of theFe(III) trichloride derivatives, as well as of two monodentate imino Fe(III) trichloridecomplexes, are described. A relationship between measured spin state and catalytic behaviouris highlighted. The fourth chapter reports the synthesis of bis-salicylaldimino Cr(II) complexes and theiractivity in the controlled radical polymerisation of styrene and vinyl acetate. The observedrearrangement of the latter monomer in the presence of chromium complexes is alsoexamined. The fifth and final experimental chapter extends the studies carried out on bissalicylaldiminoCr(II) complexes to other transition metals, namely iron and cobalt. Chapter 6 gives the experimental details for Chapters 2-4.Crystallographic data for all X-ray diffraction structures presented in this thesis are collatedin Chapter 7.

=520  3\$aThe magnitude and significance of crude oil fouling have led to a number of studies; however, the fundamentals of the complex fouling process are not fully understood. This thesis describes the use of the high chemical specificity, imaging capabilities and fast acquisition times offered by advanced vibrational spectroscopic techniques to characterise and understand the physicochemical behaviour of these complex materials. Rapid and reliable methodologies are developed to provide an important chemical characterisation tool which will advance research into crude oil fouling. An emerging and powerful imaging technique based on Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is applied for the first time to the characterisation of deposited foulants and asphaltenes. Attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR spectroscopic imaging has the advantage of being a non-destructive analytical technique and most importantly, is able to provide both chemical and spatial information about a sample. The novel application, of combining macro and microATR modes in FTIR imaging, yields important information about the spatial distribution of different components in deposited foulants and laboratory-extracted asphaltenes. Clusters of chemically different compounds in crude oil deposits from the refinery, such as asphaltenes, carbonates, sulphates, sulfoxides, oxalates and even 'coke-like' materials, were identified and analysed. A lab-made aperture is utilised in the macro ATR diamond accessory to correct spectral distortions that occur for high refractive index materials. This approach has been extended to monitor the heating of crude oil in situ and the onset of asphaltene deposition was determined. Micro ATRFTIR imaging of the particulates formed in the crude oil after heating has identified seven chemically different species, namely, silicates, amides, sulphates, carbonates, sulfoxides, vitrinite compounds and 'coke-like' materials which are products of different reactions in fouling. The complementary use of Raman and FTIR spectroscopy has been demonstrated to characterise the carbon structures in asphaltenes. The ID/IG and IV/IG parameters derived from the Raman spectra on real deposits showed that it has more ordered structures compared to petroleum asphaltenes which may be linked to the ageing effects of the deposit in heat exchangers. The ATR-FTIR spectra of petroleum asphaltenes suggest that the shape of an average asphaltene is more similar to a wide continental model than the archipelago model.

=520  3\$aThe limited knowledge of stiffness reductions is a major problem in reliablypredicting the post-impact strength of composite structures. This work describesdevelopment and application of a non-destructive approach for evaluation of the inplanestiffness of impact damage in composites. The approach combines an inverse method linked to a finite element model andnon-contact full-field measurements. The material parameters of impact damage aredetermined by iteratively matching the finite element model to displacement fieldsmeasured optically during post-impact loading. A first order, gradient optimizationtechnique coupled with a modified quadratic algorithm is employed. The method isvalidated on a reference finite element model with axisymmetric damage containingseveral concentric zones having different properties, and the influence of measurementnoise is examined. The approach is applied to in-house experiments with impacted carbon/epoxylaminates to determine their quasi-isotropic mechanical properties in tension andcompression. The resulting stiffness distributions are presented and the correspondingnonlinear behaviour of the damage is described. To examine the effect of the type ofdamage on the mechanical properties a thorough fractographic analysis of the impactedspecimens was undertaken. The tensile stiffness is found to be mainly affected by fibrefracture, while the compressive stiffness is strongly linked to delamination buckling. The approach has further been extended for detection and evaluation of multipleimpact damage zones at arbitrary locations as well as for stiffness identification of thedamage in orthotropic laminates. The accuracy of both extensions is presented anddiscussed. Finally, possible future applications of the approach are considered.

=520  3\$aBacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins expressed in commercial transgenic crop varieties are all δ-endotoxins (Cry toxins) but the identification of novel vegetative insecticidal proteins (Vip toxins) has extended the range of insecticidal proteins derived from Bt. One such Vip toxin, Vip3A, primarily targets the midgut epithelium cells of susceptible insects as Cry toxins do, although they appear to have different binding sites. The present study investigated the comparative toxicity of Vip3A, Cry1Ab andCry1Ac against Heliothis virescens (tobacco budworm) and the impact of antibiotics on Bt insecticidal activity. The selection of a resistant Vip3A population led to the determination of cross-resistance, the genetics of resistance and fitness effects. There was very little variability in the natural susceptibility to Vip3A, Cry1Ab and Cry1Acin the populations tested, although the toxicity of Vip3A was much lower compared to the Cry1A toxins. A Vip3A resistant population was successfully established within 13 selected generations, with little or no cross-resistance to Cry1Ab or Cry1Ac. The inheritance of resistance ranged from almost completely recessive to incompletely dominant with a possible paternal influence, was polygenic and relatively stable. Vip3A resistance showed a fitness benefit, reduced larval development time, and fitness costs, including survival to adult eclosion, reduced egg viability and reduced male mating success. The effects of antibiotics on H. virescens larval susceptibility to Bt toxins varied depending on antibiotic treatment, the Bt toxin used and the larval instar tested. Bt cotton expressing both Vip3A and Cry1Ab to provide activity against a wide range of pest Lepidoptera, including H. virescens, a major cotton pest in the USA is in the process of commercialisation. The present work will help to support a suitable insecticide resistance management strategy for continued use of Bt toxin in transgenic crops.

=520  3\$aThe aim of this thesis was to assess the potential of a Submerged Anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (SAMBR) for the treatment of saline organic wastewater. Firstly,it was found that anaerobic biomass can be acclimatised to salinities up to 20 g NaCl/L over a period of about 35 days during three batch feedings. Experiments were also carried out to evaluate the performance of anaerobic biomass during a sudden reduction and re-exposure to salinity; anaerobic biomass showed high performance during fluctuations in salinity. Then, SAMBRs were used for saline sewage treatment and it was found that 99% Dissolve Organic Carbon (DOC) removal could be obtained at 8 hours hydraulic retention time (HRT). Different start-up strategies and inoculation of halotolerant species into a SAMBR were investigated. In addition, the reduction of biogas sparging time caused an increase in TMP by 0.025 bar, but also an increase in effluent DOC removal and inside the SAMBR by 10% and 20%, respectively. Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) addition resulted in a TMP decrease of 0.070 bar, and a 30% and 5% increase in DOC removal inside the SAMBR and effluent, respectively. The mechanisms of anaerobic biomass under high salinity were studied by investigating the role of compatible solutes, extracellular polysaccharides (EPS), and Archaeal microbial evolution. Glycine betaine was found to have the most positive effect on anaerobic biomass when added to medium with high salinity. This was found not only in batch experiments, but also in continuous ones using a SAMBR. The effluent composition from the SAMBR treating saline wastewater was analysed, and post treatment strategies using mainly PAC were analysed. The treatment of this effluent with 1.7 g PAC/L can lead to greater than 80% DOC removal. The treatment of wastewater with high salinity and Cr (III) in a system consisting of a SAMBR, anaerobic Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) and a PAC column was examined. The system obtained 95% and 70% removal of Cr (III) and Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), respectively. Using molecular techniques inside the SAMBR, species were identified that were capable of surviving in high salinity and Cr (III). In a short-period experiment, relaxation, liquid backwash and gas backwash techniques were compared and showed the superiority of gas backwashing to reduce fouling of the membrane. The specific resistances of a membrane operated for 100 days in the SAMBR showed that more than 90% of the total resistance was attributed to the biofilm cake layer, about 5-7% to the compounds attached on the membrane surface and about 3% to the membrane resistance and to the compounds in the inner pores of the membrane.

=520  3\$aNile crocodiles were extensively persecuted throughout much of the 20th century. The extinction of the species was only averted by the timely intervention ofconservationists and by the beginning of the 21st century most populations hadrecovered. Many of the conservation measures designed to curb the original extinctionthreats remain unchanged and are now perceived by some to be outdated. The recoveryof Nile crocodile populations has been accompanied by rapid human population growthand demands for freshwater resources. This phenomenon has resulted in a convergingconflict crisis between Nile crocodiles and humans. The aim of this thesis is to (a)quantify the extent of human crocodile conflict (HCC) and (b) establish theimplications for conservation and development.(a)The extent of HCC was assessed by (i) analysing losses incurred by localcommunities (ii) analysing the demographics of crocodiles in relation to humanactivities (iii) analysing the relationship between humans and crocodile prey species. Nile crocodiles pose a substantial threat to subsistence livelihoods whilst ruralcommunities have significant negative impacts on crocodiles (i) Estimates suggest anannual loss of between ~255 and ~6864 cattle per year and damage to an estimated71500 fishing nets per year in North Eastern Namibia. (ii) All crocodile size classesshowed a negative relationship with people at the inter- and intra-river levels. (iii)Crocodile prey species showed a significant negative spatial relationship with cattle.(b) Conservation and management implications were assessed by estimating thespatial patterns of HCC explanatory variables on a continental scale. Protected areas areimportant for crocodile conservation. The use of crocodile habitat as boundaries forprotected areas raises important questions relating to HCC.

=520  3\$aCyclotides are a unique class of head-to-tail cyclic cysteine-knot microproteins that exhibit a wide range of biological activities ranging from insecticidal to anti-HIV. They have a unique structure in which two disulfide bridges form a ring through which a third disulfide bridge is threaded, making cyclotides exceptionally stable against thermal and proteolytic degradation. This characteristic makes them of great interest in drug discovery. MCoTI-I and MCoTI-II, which originally were extracted from Momordica cochenchinesis, are examples of macrocyclic cysteine knot microproteins that display extremely potent trypsin inhibitory activity. In this thesis, two distinct complementary approaches have been developed for the first total synthesis of MCoTI-I and MCoTI-II. In the first, termed thia zip native chemical ligation (NCL), the cyclic backbone and three disulfide bonds are formed in a one pot reaction. In the second, backbone ligation is achieved via a novel immobilised protease-mediated ligation reaction. These methodologies have been further applied to the synthesis of novel analogues of the natural MCoTI-II structure modified at a key residue in the active loop (Lys10) that have altered protease inhibition specificity together with minimizing of MCoTI-II size. These wild-type and re-engineered MCoTI cyclotides were found to be active against not only trypsin-like serine proteases; trypsin, chymotrypsin, leukocyte elastase, HCV NS3/4A, β-tryptase and matriptase, but they are also active against cysteine protease; foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV 3Cpro).

=520  3\$aChanges in wing development and development through the stadia of Aphis fabaeare examined after parasitisation by Aphidius colemani along with the underlying mechanisms. Parasitoid oviposition into nymphs of winged gynoparae of A. fabaeshows that wing development is inhibited and the earlier parasitism takes place, the stronger the effect. Consideration of the timing of events indicates that the active component(s) is most likely injected during oviposition and is not related to hatching and growing of the parasitoid larva. When extracts of venom glands are injected into late-second stadium aphids, many develop to fourth-stadium possessing rudimentary wingbuds, show developmental arrest and often die while moulting to the adult stage. Injections with extracts of female or male parasitoids into later stadia give similar results with regard to development to the adult but aphids injected in the late-fourth stadium develop normally. Experiments with long-day winged virginoparae reveal similar results in development to the adult but injections into long-day wingless aphids, which develop more rapidly, show this effect only when performed early in the third stadium. The earlier the injection before the final moult the greater the effect of the extract on preventing adult development. The results indicate that there is an active factor(s) in the female parasitoid's venom that disrupts wing development and/or inhibits development to the adult; the loss of activity after treatment at 100 °C or with protease makes it likely that the factor(s) is a protein. Surprisingly, injections of extracts from male parasitoids have similar effects. The location and function of such a factor(s) in males are unknown. Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography is used to fractionate the parasitoid extracts and bioassays reveal activity in fractions 16-25. Aphidius ervi venom also inhibits development of A. fabae (a non-host) whereas A. colemani venom has no effect on the development of Megoura viciae (a non-host). Injection with lipopolysaccharides and infection with a fungal pathogen are used to test whether stimulation of the immune response affects wing development in the host and the possibility that the host is in control of inhibiting its own wing development in order to support its immune system is discussed.

=520  3\$aThis research focuses on the development of whole column detection (WCD) forliquid chromatography (LC). The WCD uses electrochemical techniques for detectingthe analytes passing through the separation column. Electrode array for in-columnelectrochemical detection (ICED) is fabricated along the separation column to enablewhole column separation monitoring and allow better understanding on the affinity ofparticular analyte to the stationary and mobile phases. Numerical models were built to understand the feasibility and differences ofelectrochemical detection within an unpacked and packed column. From the simulatedresults, the surface area of the electrode was not hindered by the presence of theparticles in flow condition. An electrochemical microfluidic device has been successfully fabricated on PET(polyethylene terephthalate) substrate using the reverse imprinting technique. Thephotolithographically produced gold metal electrode lines were imprinted into thePET substrate using a blank mould and produced an inlaid electrode array with overallstep residue within 40 nm. The semi-cured thermoset polyester channel wasirreversibly thermal bonded on the PET substrate. The devices were able to toleratepressure in excess of 90 bars. The PET column was packed with 5 ?m C18 silicabeads to perform reverse phase chromatography separation. The array was electrochemically characterised using standard redox probes in bothstagnant conditions and under flow. Both numerical modelling and experimental datashow improved sensitivity under flow and a limiting current which scaled linearlywith cubic root of volume flow rate. Isocratic and gradient mode chromatographicseparations of neurotransmitters and metabolites: serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, 5-HIAA and DOPAC were conducted in the fabricated device. Separation progress waselectrochemically detected at multiple locations along the column. Whole columnassessment on separation efficiency and column packing efficiency monitoring wereconducted using the ICED.

=520  3\$aTissue engineering with fibrous scaffolds is emerging as a major research area in the field of regenerative medicine. The major themes pursued in this thesis are the study of the cellular response to nanofibrous constructs, the role of nanofibres in the engineering of synthetic scaffolds, and the development of technology to facilitate the fabrication of nanofibrous scaffolds with controlled architectures. Cells cultured on multi-walled carbon nanotubes displayed reduced proliferation and altered cytoskeletal development, thought to be due to the undermining of the maturation of focal adhesions. Development of an electrospinning chamber enabled the creation of poly(methyl methacrylate), poly(lactic acid) and poly(caprolactone) fibres for the study of cellular response to nano- and macro-fibrous scaffolds. Cell attachment and organisation on the electrospun fibres was visualised using scanning electron microscopy, oblique microscopy and live cell microscopy. It was found that the incorporation of nanofibres into scaffolds restricts the maturation of focal adhesions which modulates cytoskeletal formation. This can be used to restrict the migration and the proliferation of attachment dependant cells such as osteoblasts or maintain the differentiation of cells such as chondrocytes. To scale up electrospun fibre production, use of rotating collectors, multi-jet spinning and secondary electrodes to focus the spinning were investigated. Further to this, development of an array of focusing electrodes to control, stabilise and deflect the jet was also investigated towards the creation of a rapid prototype electrospinning system. The secondary electrode array was found to reduce the spreading of the jet to a spot diameter of 10mm and charged deflection plates successfully redirecting the position of the jet as it arrived at the collector.

=520  3\$aThe research described in this thesis covers two fields of investigation:1) Biaryl and styrene Synthesis by Cross-Coupling of Fluorous-tagged Photo-activatedArylgermanes and Towards the Preparation of Boscalid and AnaloguesBiaryls are generally prepared by cross-coupling between aryl metals. However, even themost robust of these aryl metal species cannot be carried through complex syntheticsequences due to their reactivity particularly towards electrophiles. In this thesis, thedevelopment of trialkylgermanes as ?safety-catch? coupling precursors for biaryl and styrenesynthesis was achieved. The safety-catch germanes are fluorous-tagged to facilitate parallelsynthesis using fluorous SPE techniques and are activated towards Pd(0)-catalysedcross-coupling with aryl bromides by oxidative photolysis using a UV lamp. The stabilityprofile of the fluorous-tagged arylgermanes was examined. They are stable under strongbasic, nucleophilic and reductive conditions but labile in acidic and oxidative environments. This stability profile provides unique opportunities for synthetic route design in targetorientated syntheses by allowing the germane group to be installed early in the sequence butonly activated for cross-coupling when required. This method has been applied to thesynthesis of the plant anti-fungal agent boscalid? and its alkynyl derivatives.2) Novel Protocol for Solid Phase Synthesis of Radio-iodinated Ligands for Imagingof Cannabinoid Receptors in the BrainRimonabant? is a CB1 receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of obesity, metabolicsyndrome, addiction and smoking cessation. Radio-labelled analogues are potential PET(Positron Emission Tomography) and SPECT (Single Photon Emission ComputedTomography) imaging agents for visualising the distribution of cannabinoid receptors inthe brain for medical research. Conventional methods for the preparation of radio-iodinatedcannabinoid receptor ligands employ organostannane precursors which undergoelectrophilic ipso-iododestannylation with concomitant formation of toxic organostannaneby-products. Rigorous removed of organostannane residues is necessary prior to injectionthe ligand for in vivo experiments. In this thesis, a novel, non-toxic, solid-supported andfacile approach for the parallel synthesis of iodinated cannabinoid receptor ligands basedon the skeleton of rimonabant has been demonstrated.

=520  3\$aStructural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems are widely regarded as capable ofsignificantly reducing inspection costs of safety-critical structures in industries suchas aerospace, nuclear, and oil and gas, among others. Successful SHM systems canbe considered those which combine good sensitivity to defects, preferably with thecapability of localization and identification, with a low sensor density. Techniquesbased on sparse arrays of sensors which generate and receive guided waves are amongthe most promising candidates. Guided waves propagate over large distances andcertain modes have the ability to transmit through a variety of structural featuresleading to a relatively small number of distributed sensors being able to cover thestructure. In complex structures, which contain high densities of structural elements, the timetracesobtained are often too complex to be directly interpreted due to the largenumber of overlapping reflections. In this case, the Baseline Subtraction techniquebecomes attractive. In this method a current signal from the structure is subtractedfrom a signal which has been acquired during the initial stages of operation of thestructure. This eliminates the need for interpretation of the complex raw time signaland any defects will be clearly seen provided the amplitude of the residual signal obtainedafter subtraction of the baseline signal is sufficiently low when the structure isundamaged. However, it is well known that environmental effects such as stress, ambienttemperature variations and liquid loading affect the velocity of guided waves;this modifies the time-traces and leads to high levels of residual signal if a singlebaseline, taken under different conditions, is used. Of these effects, temperaturevariations are the most commonly encountered and are critical since they affect notonly the wave propagation but also the response of transducers. The present work aims to demonstrate the potential of guided wave health monitoringof large area complex structures. It starts with a general literature reviewon inspection and monitoring of large area structures, in which the advantages anddisadvantages of this technique compared to other well-established SHM techniques are presented. The design and behaviour of two different temperature-stable transducersgenerating high A0 or S0 mode purity in the sub-200kHz frequency regionare described. The effciency of different signal processing techniques aimed at reducingor eliminating the influence of temperature on wave propagation is evaluatedand a temperature compensation signal processing strategy is proposed. Finally, alarge metallic structure is used to demonstrate a sparse-array SHM system basedon this signal processing strategy, and imaging algorithms are used to combine theinformation from a large number of sensor combinations, ultimately leading to thelocalization of defects artificially introduced in the structure.

=520  3\$aSince 2004 Imperial College has been developing the world?s first application-specificinstrumentation aiming at the on-line, in-situ, physiochemical monitoring of adult stemcell cultures. That effort is internationally known as the ?Intelligent Stem Cell CultureSystems? (ISCCS) project. The ISCCS platform is formed by the functional integrationof biosensors, interfacing electronics and bioreactors. Contrary to the PCB-levelISCCS platform the work presented in this thesis relates to the realization of a miniaturizedcell culture monitoring platform. Specifically, this thesis details the synthesis andfabrication of pivotal VLSI circuit blocks suitable for the construction of a miniaturizedmicroelectronic cell monitoring platform. The thesis is composed of two main parts. The first part details the design and operation of a two-stage current-input currentoutputtopology suitable for three-electrode amperometric sensor measurements. Thefirst stage is a CMOS-dual rail-class AB-current conveyor providing a low impedancevirtualground node for a current input. The second stage is a novel hyperbolic-sinebasedexternally-linear internally-non-linear current amplification stage. This stagebases its operation upon the compressive sinh?1 conversion of the interfaced currentto an intermediate auxiliary voltage and the subsequent sinh expansion of the samevoltage. The proposed novel topology has been simulated for current-gain values rangingfrom 10 to 1000 using the parameters of the commercially available 0.8?m AMSCMOS process. Measured results from a chip fabricated in the same technology are alsoreported. The proposed interfacing/amplification architecture consumes 0.88-95?W. The second part describes the design and practical evaluation of a 13.56MHz frequencyshift keying (FSK) short-range (5cm) telemetry link suitable for the monitoring of incubatedcultures. Prior to the design of the full FSK radio system, a pair of 13.56MHzantennae are characterized experimentally. The experimental S-parameter-value determinationof the 13.56MHz wireless link is incorporated into the Cadence DesignFramework allowing a high fidelity simulation of the reported FSK radio. The transmitterof the proposed system is a novel multi-tapped seven-stage ring-oscillator-basedVCO whereas the core of the receiver is an appropriately modified phase locked loop(PLL). Simulated and measured results from a 0.8?m CMOS technology chip are reported.

=520  3\$aParallel flow in the scrape-off layer is a major area of interest in tokamak research, impacting on impurity transport, tritium retention and H-mode access. The work presented here is the first major investigation of SOL flow in the Mega Ampere Spherical Tokamak (MAST), using a Gundestrup probe specifically designed for the task. The results of a parameter scan in poloidal field, B*, and temperature, T, of parallel velocity at the outboard mid-plane are presented, and the results and scalings compared to B2SOLPS5.0 simulations of MAST and a simple analytical model, in order to identify the relative importance of drift mechanisms (such as Pfirsch-Schluter and E x B) for driving parallel flow. The results show the predicted linear scaling with temperature and poloidal field strength, but also suggest a density dependence. Another major are of interest is the discovery in recent years of coherent filamentary structures that are radially convected through the L-mode SOL. These filaments are believed to contain sharp gradients in temperature, density and plasma potential, complicating probe analysis. An investigation to characterise the intermittency of the MAST SOL, its dependencies on poloidal field strength, density or temperature, and the impact of the filaments on probe measurements was also carried out, and a probe was built to further investigate the structure and dynamics of the filaments. Based on these experiments a method for resolving the flow in the filaments and background plasma was developed and applied in the flow experiments described above. It is found that the parallel Mach numbers are lower in the filaments than the ambient plasma in the far SOL - suggesting either ion temperatures are at least on the order of 4 times the electron temperature - or parallel flow velocity is substantially lower in the filaments than in the background plasma.

=520  3\$aIntroduction: Patellofemoral dysfunction following total knee replacement(TKR) is significant. Due to the intimate relationship of the femoral component and patella, aspects of knee arthroplasty such as femoral component malrotation and patellofemoral overstuff have been sited as predisposing factors to such complications. The principal structures of the extensor retinaculum act as a check rein for the patella as it tracks over the femur. Little biomechanical information is available on the behaviour of these structures, or the effects of TKR on them. Aim: The aim of this thesis was to measure retinacular behaviour in the normal knee and following TKR. We hypothesise that TKR will cause significant elongation of the retinacula and this would be further deranged with the addition of femoral component malrotation and patellofemoral overstuff. Methods: Retinacular length changes were measured by threading fine sutures along the retinacula and attaching these to displacement transducers. The intact knee was flexed-extended on a custom built rig, while the quadriceps were tensed. Measurements were repeated post-TKR (Genesis II CR, Smith & Nephew Co.), following internal/external rotation of the femoral component 5° and finally altering the resurfaced patellar thickness by 2mm increments. Results: The medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) was close to isometric, whereas the lateral retinaculum slackened significantly with knee extension. TKR did not cause statistically significant elongation of the retinacula. Internal rotation of the femoral component resulted in the MPFL slackening whereas external rotation resulted in the MPFL tightening as the knee extended. The lateral retinaculum showed no significant differences. Overstuffing the patellofemoral joint caused significant stretching of the MPFL at all angles of knee flexion, but very little change in the lateral retinaculum. Conclusion: This work has shown a correctly positioned TKR does not cause significant retinacular length changes sufficient to affect knee function. It has shown that small changes in femoral component rotation and patellofemoral overstuff of 4mm cause significant changes, particularly in the medial structures and not the lateral structures, contrary to current understanding. This work has described for the first time how the lateral retinaculum's mobile attachments allow its principal fibres to move anteriorly and posteriorly with the patella, taking up any slack/tension produced by abnormal patellar shift/tilt. This work provides important insight into the contribution of the retinacula to patellofemoral biomechanics after knee replacements and may help in developing a more soft tissue friendly knee prosthesis.

=520  3\$aThe objective of this work is to compare the performance of different geometries (i.e. planar, coplanar and micro tubular) under single-chamber (mixed-reactant) solid oxide fuel cell (SC-SOFC) conditions. In this respect, these designs have been computer analyzed and it is found that the micro-tubular design eliminates the possibility of cross diffusion/convection from the counter electrode, which is an inherent disadvantage in planar and co-planar designs. This is the first experimental report describing that the micro-tubular design offers the highest fuel utilization, cell efficiency and an acceptable level of performance (under single-chamber conditions) as compared to other designs. With the help of developed numerical model (also the first one, on mixed-reactant, micro-tubular design), it is demonstrated that there is a possibility of further improvement in performance, e.g. cell positioning, micro-tube diameter and cathode morphology (its micro-structure and material) are important factors to consider. Other parameters such as, flow rate, temperature and mixing ratio are also very effective in improving the cell performance but these parameters should be carefully controlled in order to avoid their counter-effects, like, lower fuel utilization, material degradation, anode coking and oxidation-reduction. There are some other parameters such as, electrode porosity, permeability and cathode radiative emissivity, which have minimal effect in performance enhancement and it is suggested before investing time on these parameters, a net energy and cost analysis would be very helpful. There are still some issues with choosing appropriate materials for building an SC-SOFC with both an acceptable lifetime and production of electrical energy. While it has been observed that most of the problems related to material degradation are thermally driven, it would be very helpful to lower the operating temperature by using intermediate temperature SOFC materials. Further to this, long term degradation studies and performance cycling will benefit in order to determine their suitability under mixed-reactant environment.

=520  3\$aBreast cancer growth is estrogen- regulated in many cases. Estrogen actions are mediated by estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ. Whilst the involvement of ERβ in breast cancer is unresolved at present, up to 80% of breast tumours are ERα- positive and likely to respond to endocrine therapies, such as anti-estrogens. However, a substantial proportion of patients develop a resistance to such treatments. Most resistant tumours continue to express ERα and many will respond to an alternative hormonal therapy, indicating that ERα continues to be important following the emergence of resistance. One proposed mechanism for endocrine resistance is post-translational modification of the ERα, particularly phosphorylation of ERα within the transcription activation domain AF1. This project investigates how the phosphorylation at residues within the AF1 domain is linked to ERα activation and tumour cell growth in the presence of tamoxifen and in the absence of ligand, by stable introduction of ERα phosphorylation site mutants in the MCF7 human breast cancer cell line, commonly used as a model for ERα-positive breast cancer. Characterisation of these lines suggests that phosphorylation at the sites within the AF1 domain of the ER increases the agonist activity of tamoxifen. Further studies to determine the mechanisms by which ERα activity is regulated by phosphorylation within AF1 are discussed.

=520  3\$aThe increase in popularity of the microgrid concept requires the analysis and solution ofthe numerous technical issues arising from the operation and integration of the microgridinto the original distribution network. The work presented in this thesis is centred onthe study of the fault behaviour of inverter-only microgrids and on the development of asuitable fault detection technique. This task is approached by first understanding the behaviour of a microgrid during afault and the factors affecting it. A complete description and analysis of the key elementsin the study of microgrid fault behaviour is presented. Then, three microgrid models withdifferent inverter control methods (i.e. Synchronous Reference Frame control, NaturalReference Frame control and droop control) and with various current limiting strategiesare built in PSCAD and their fault behaviour is simulated, analyzed and compared. It is found that the control of the inverter is able to shape the response of themicrogrid in the event of a fault. The constraints to this capability are the inverter?s ratings(current and voltage limits) and the characteristic changes in the network introduced byfaults. Moreover, it is found that the control in the Natural Reference Frame gives betterfault response, in terms of voltage control and simplicity in implementation, comparedwith the popular control in the Synchronous Reference Frame. The behaviour of the system is then further analyzed by developing quasi steadystateinverter models suitable for numerical fault analysis. The models are developedstarting from the inverter control and analyzing how it changes in the event of a fault. Bycombining control gains and circuit parameters, they result in being capable of capturingthe key features of inverters? fault behaviour. Depending on the control strategy, some ofthese models are balanced and therefore are directly applicable in numerical fault analysisbased on sequence components. Others are unbalanced and therefore require a fault analysisbased on a direct phase coordinates representation of the network. Examples on howto perform numerical fault analysis calculations with balanced and unbalanced models aregiven and the numerical results well compare with the ones obtained from time-domainsimulations using PSCAD.From the knowledge of the microgrid fault behaviour developed analyzing the responsesin time-domain simulations and by using the developed inverter models to numericallycalculate voltages and currents in the microgrid during different faults at variouslocations, a fault detection strategy based on voltage sequence components is proposed. Indeed, it is the behaviour of the inverter control during faults which makes the monitoringof voltage sequence components the best discriminator between normal operationand fault operation. The three building blocks of the fault detection strategy which arecapable of a fast extraction and comparison of voltage sequence components are describedand then the performance of the fault detection strategy for different faults and microgridoperating conditions is tested in PSCAD and discussed. Finally, examples are given onhow this voltage detection can be used in the design of a microgrid protection system.

=520  3\$aThis research concerns the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of turbulent combustion inboth the premixed and the non-premixed regime. Non-premixed hybrid bluff-body/swirlflames are simulated by means of a steady flamelet model (Flamelet-LES) based ondetailed chemical kinetics. LES of lean premixed twin flames stabilised on a turbulentopposed jet (TOJ) burner are carried out using an algebraic Flame Surface Density model(FSD-LES) and a newly developed model based on Linear Eddy Mixing (LEM-LES).Isothermal swirling flow at a medium Reynolds and swirl number is simulated first andthe LES model is shown to accurately predict the velocity statistics and the complexflow field governed by vortex breakdown and two recirculation zones. The Flamelet-LES model is subsequently used to simulate a low speed swirling methane flame andthe capability of the model to predict downstream recirculation, vortex breakdown andcentral jet precession in the presence of heat release is demonstrated. The simulation oftwo high speed hydrogen/methane swirl flames with the Flamelet-LES model shows thatsome quantitative predictions of this challenging test case for combustion simulation canbe achieved, while the overall predictions are not satisfactory. The flamelet approach isfound sensitive to minor errors in the mixing field which strongly affect the simulationresults due to the highly non-linear mixture fraction/density relationship. Non-reacting simulations of turbulent opposed jet flows at moderate Reynolds numberare performed and compared to experimental reference data. The inclusion of the flowfield inside the nozzles into the computational domain is shown to yield accurate predictionsof the velocity statistics between the nozzles. For these predictions the detailedknowledge of the initial jet development region near the turbulence generating plates isvital and provided by PIV measurements inside a glass nozzle. FSD-LES of the twin premixedTOJ flames show that the velocity statistics, both along the burner axis and thestagnation plane, can be predicted to high accuracy. However, the algebraic flame surfacedensity model employed in the present study requires the adjustment of a model parameterand as a result, predictions of the turbulent burning velocity cannot be achieved. Thecomparison of two different interpretations of the FSD model show that a formulationusing an additional diffusion term allows for a better resolution of the premixed flamesin LES than the original formulation without diffusion. A complex LEM combustion model is first developed as a Stand-Alone approach tosimulate premixed combustion and subsequently coupled to LES. The LEM-LES modelrequires a number of sub-models to represent the effects of sub-grid stirring, finite-ratechemistry, sub-grid expansion, 3D convection (splicing) and flame propagation whichare described in detail. The LEM-LES model is - to the author's knowledge - thefirst attempt to simulate premixed flames with finite-rate chemistry in incompressibleturbulent flow. Preliminary results from the application of LEM-LES to the premixedtwin TOJ flames are reported and show a high sensitivity to the 3D convection modeland the requirement to improve the splicing procedure for premixed flames in anisotropicturbulent flow. The difficulty to accurately resolve the turbulent flow field by LES whilesimultaneously accommodating a premixed flame of finite thickness on the LEM sub-gridis found to be a challenge for the LEM-LES of premixed TOJ flames.

=520  3\$aParkinson's disease is an age related progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting ~2% of the population over the age of 65. The aetiology of Parkinson's disease is not fully understood and treatment limited. Hence, the goal of ongoing research is to understand and target the mechanisms underlying the disease process to halt or slow down its progression. Parkinson's disease is pathologically characterised by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantial nigra that leads to the loss of innervation to the striatum, subsequently leading to the motor complications observed in Parkinson's sufferers. Recent clinical and experimental evidence suggests that inflammation, characterised by over activation of the brain's resident immune cells such as microglia/macrophages, play a detrimental role in Parkinson's pathology. This project, for the first time, aims to explore the time course of microglial activation in association with dopaminergic neuronal cell death in the substantia nigra utilising the 6-hydroxydopamine rat model of Parkinson's. The dynamics of morphological, immunophenotypic and phagocytic properties of activated microglia in the substantia nigra was assessed immunohistochemically. In addition we explored the cellular events between activated microglia and degenerating neurons in this model that had not been previously well defined. The role of matrix metalloproteinases as signalling molecules that activate microglia were also studied. Finally the significance of local microglial activation in the substantia nigra was elucidated by modulation of the microglial response via activation of the gamma subtype of peroxisome proliferator activated receptors. This project provided evidence that microglial activation preceded dopaminergic neuronal cell death in the substantia nigra and inhibition of microglial response serves as a neuroprotective strategy in Parkinson's disease.

=520  3\$aThe production of aluminium sheet is expensive and energy intensivedespite the reduced environmental impact during use. Twin rollcasting is a method of directly producing aluminium alloys in near netshape directly to sheet at a fraction of the energy costs of conventionalDC casting / hot rolling. It also requires a fraction of the capital cost. Although sheet can be produced, defects (segregates, surface bleeds,buckling, etc.) can arise which limit the range of alloys which can becast. This project aims to elucidate the complex mechanisms causingthese defects through a combined experimental and computationalstudy of semi-solid deformation in aluminium alloys. Columnar dendritic structures were generated for Al-Cu alloys throughdirectional solidi cation experiments and quanti ed in three dimensions(3D) using x-ray microtomography (XMT). The -Al and theCu-rich interdendritic liquid were segmented using image analysis. These 3D datasets were exported as meshes to be used in controlvolume and nite element codes. Firstly, the ow between the dendriteswas simulated by solving the Stokes equation and permeabilitytensor was calculated as a function of the fraction solid. The size ofrepresentative volume element was estimated to be 4-6 times the characteristiclength scale in the microstructure. Secondly, nite elementsimulations were performed on 3D columnar dendritic structures to estimatetheir mechanical properties and derive constitutive behaviouras a function of temperature, strain-rate and fraction solid. Temperatureand strain-rate dependent compression tests were performedin the Gleeble on alloys with dendritic composition to determine the mechanical properties of the monolithic Al-dendrites. The fractionsolid dependency term in the constitutive equation was determinedas a purely geometric factor which could be easily replicated in otheralloys systems. Lastly, hot tearing was directly observed in an Al-12 wt.%Cu alloy by combining x-ray/synchrotron radiography with anew tensile/compression apparatus capable of measuring strain, loadand quantifying the microstructure during controlled solidi cation ofAl alloy specimen. Using this new apparatus, the deformation of primarydendrites and the concomitant ow of Cu-rich interdendriticuid was observed during isothermal and constant cooling rate conditions. Initially, strain was observed to be accommodated by liquidow, but as the load is increased, void formation combined with liquidnecking between grains was prevalent.

=520  3\$aThis thesis is concerned with the optimisation of Digital Signal Processing (DSP) algorithmimplementations on recon gurable hardware via the selection of appropriate word-lengthsfor the signals in these algorithms, in order to minimise system power consumption. Whilstexisting word-length optimisation work has concentrated on the minimisation of the area ofalgorithm implementations, this work introduces the rst set of power consumption modelsthat can be evaluated quickly enough to be used within the search of the enormous designspace of multiple word-length optimisation problems. These models achieve their speed byestimating both the power consumed within the arithmetic components of an algorithmand the power in the routing wires that connect these components, using only a high-leveldescription of the algorithm itself. Trading o a small reduction in power model accuracyfor a large increase in speed is one of the major contributions of this thesis. In addition to the work on power consumption modelling, this thesis also develops anew technique for selecting the appropriate word-lengths for an algorithm implementationin order to minimise its cost in terms of power (or some other metric for which modelsare available). The method developed is able to provide tight lower and upper bounds onthe optimal cost that can be obtained for a particular word-length optimisation problemand can, as a result, nd provably near-optimal solutions to word-length optimisationproblems without resorting to an NP-hard search of the design space. Finally the costs of systems optimised via the proposed technique are compared tothose obtainable by word-length optimisation for minimisation of other metrics (such aslogic area) and the results compared, providing greater insight into the nature of wordlengthoptimisation problems and the extent of the improvements obtainable by them.

=520  3\$aThis thesis examines the impact of HIV superinfection (infection of HIV-positive individuals by a heterologous HIV strain after immune responses have been established against the first strain) upon HIV disease progression and viral blips, and the relationship between non-adherence to cART and the occurrence of viral blips. For these purposes, a mathematical model of HIV within-host dynamics with two strains has been developed. My results suggest: firstly, HIV superinfection in and of itself was found not leading to faster progression to AIDS; it is only superinfection with strains of a higher replication capacity that does. Secondly, it was found that superinfecting strains susceptible to the existing cART regimen cannot establish themselves in patients, while those resistant to the regiment will lead to treatment failure. Superinfection in either scenario will not lead to viral blips. Thirdly, the choice of sampling frame was found to have a significant impact upon the observed number and incidence of viral blips. Instead of calculating the incidence of blips from their observed number over a period of time, one should take into account the sampling frame and calculate the proportion of blips among the measurements made over that period. Fourthly, increased drug adherence three days before a clinic visit does not mask poor adherence; regular consecutive non-adherence results in more blips than a random non-adherence pattern; and dose-timing variation around the regimen-prescribed time leads to more blips. Fifthly, the non-linear relationship between the proportion of measurements with detectable viral blips and the probable drug adherence of a patient, and how this relationship varies with the viral replication rate, are studied. This thesis improves our understanding of anti-HIV immune responses, refines our public health messages and provides us with indications of drug adherence through observation of viral blips with different sampling frames.

=520  3\$aBreast cancer is the most common malignancy in women in the Western world, accounting for 18% of all female cancers. Two-thirds of breast cancers express Estrogen receptor-α (ERα) and ERα is a predictive and positive prognostic marker. Estrogens stimulate breast cancer growth, primarily through activation of ERα and hormonal therapies used in breast cancer treatment either inhibit estrogen synthesis to prevent ERα activation or bind to ERα to inhibit its activation. Unfortunately resistance to these drugs is a common clinical problem. Altered phosphorylation of ERα has been proposed as one of the mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy. Phosphorylation of ERα can result in its activation, both in the presence and absence of ligand. The key phosphorylation sites have been mapped to transcription activation function AF1. In particular, phosphorylation of serine residues at amino acid positions 104, 106 and 118 in AF1 results in stimulation of ERα activity. A wealth of evidence demonstrates an important role for the ERK1/2MAPK signal transduction pathway in non-responsiveness to endocrine therapies. However, it remains unclear as to how phosphorylation potentiates the activity of AF1. It is likely that phosphorylation of AF1 stimulates the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators that mediate the transcriptional activity of AF1. Identification and characterisation of such coactivators would further our understanding of the role of phosphorylation in the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation by ERα. Two approaches were used to identify coactivators that may mediate the effects of ERα phosphorylation on its activity. In the first approach, bacterial two-hybrid system was used to screen a breast cDNA expression library. In the second, p68and p72 RNA helicases, two known transcriptional coregulators, previously reported to interact with AF1 of ERα, were characterised as coactivators of ERα. Both proteins stimulated activity of ERα and show synergism with the well-characterised nuclear receptor coactivator, SRC-1. Surprisingly, reporter gene assays showed that phosphorylation of ERα is not essential for the coactivator function of p68. Importantly, RNA interference studies revealed complex effects of p68 and p72 on ERα activity and consequently on estrogen-regulated gene expression. p72 knockdown reduced the expression of the estrogen-regulated genes, pS2, Cathepsin D and GREB1, and inhibited the growth of the ERα-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Surprisingly, p68 knockdown did not affect ER signalling. Data are also presented to suggest that the balance and interplay between p68 and p72 may be responsible for the previously described regulation of ERα activity by p68. Collectively, the data presented show that p72 may be more important than p68 in modulating transcriptional responsesof ERα in breast cancer cells.

=520  3\$aThis thesis details investigations into the aerodynamic properties of a small, rapidlyactuated,actively controlled trailing-edge ap and the potential of such a device toalleviate the unsteady loading experienced by wind turbine blades due to atmosphericturbulence and the atmospheric boundary layer, although such a device would havepotential applications in other elds such as rotorcraft. The main goals of this work were to investigate whether aerodynamic loadings couldin fact be alleviated by the use of a small trailing-edge ap using only measurements ofthe unsteady lift on the wing as a control input and to assess such a device s capacity toreject atmospheric disturbances with both numerical and experimental work, carriedout in the Aeronautics Department at Imperial College London. The numerical work covered in the thesis comprises the results of linear and nonlinearaerodynamic and control simulations (e.g. PID, LQG controllers) and the resultsof computational uid dynamics (CFD) simulations using the commercial packageFLUENT. The thesis also lays out the results obtained from testing an experimentalprototype in the Hydrodynamics Laboratory in the Aeronautics Department. Thisprototype successfully rejected intentionally introduced ow disturbances from thevortex street of a square block upstream of the wing and the application of controlprovided a very signi cant reduction in the unsteady loading experienced by the wing. The ndings show the potential of this method of load control for the rejection ofunsteady aerodynamic loading by the sole use of measurements of the wing loadingand this has been demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally. The work isclosed with a conclusion and suggestions for future research proposals.

=520  3\$aCurrently there is no complete face recognition system that is invariant to all facial expressions. Although humans find it easy to identify and recognise faces regardless of changes in illumination,pose and expression, producing a computer system with a similar capability has proved tobe particularly di cult. Three dimensional face models are geometric in nature and thereforehave the advantage of being invariant to head pose and lighting. However they are still susceptibleto facial expressions. This can be seen in the decrease in the recognition results usingprincipal component analysis when expressions are added to a data set. In order to achieve expression-invariant face recognition systems, we have employed a tensoralgebra framework to represent 3D face data with facial expressions in a parsimoniousspace. Face variation factors are organised in particular subject and facial expression modes. We manipulate this using single value decomposition on sub-tensors representing one variationmode. This framework possesses the ability to deal with the shortcomings of PCA in less constrainedenvironments and still preserves the integrity of the 3D data. The results show improvedrecognition rates for faces and facial expressions, even recognising high intensity expressionsthat are not in the training datasets. We have determined, experimentally, a set of anatomical landmarks that best describe facialexpression e ectively. We found that the best placement of landmarks to distinguish di erentfacial expressions are in areas around the prominent features, such as the cheeks and eyebrows. Recognition results using landmark-based face recognition could be improved with better placement. We looked into the possibility of achieving expression-invariant face recognition by reconstructingand manipulating realistic facial expressions. We proposed a tensor-based statisticaldiscriminant analysis method to reconstruct facial expressions and in particular to neutralisefacial expressions. The results of the synthesised facial expressions are visually more realisticthan facial expressions generated using conventional active shape modelling (ASM). Wethen used reconstructed neutral faces in the sub-tensor framework for recognition purposes. The recognition results showed slight improvement. Besides biometric recognition, this noveltensor-based synthesis approach could be used in computer games and real-time animationapplications.

=520  3\$aCerebral palsy (CP) is a neuromuscular disorder that affects the motor control of muscles. CP children exhibit abnormal walking patterns and frequently develop lower limb, long bone deformities. To improve functionality and guide orthopaedic treatments effectively, it is critical to elucidate the relationship existing between bone morphology and movement of the lower limbs in CP children. The hypothesis of this study is that gait abnormalities result in bone deformities. The investigation of this complex relationship represents the core of this thesis. The examination of magnetic resonance images and gait analysis of healthy and CP children showed different development in femoral and tibial morphology and varied gait characteristics between them. Similarly, different correlations between bone morphology and gait characteristics resulted in healthy and CP children. Gait characteristics also varied between CP children. An objective and quantitative graphical classification method of CP gait patterns was developed. This classified the CP children in overlapping clusters according to their gait patterns, confirming the presence of multiple gait abnormalities on the same lower limb for CP children. With the intention to define the effect of the walking characteristics on the bone structure, femoral muscle and hip contact forces in healthy and CP children with different walking strategies were estimated by using inverse dynamic analysis. The different gait styles resulted in different loadings on the developing femur bone. These constituted the loading conditions for bone growth analysis. A three-dimensional finite element model for femoral growth was developed and mechanobiological theories applied in order to predict femur changes over time in healthy and CP children. The models predicted higher femoral anteversion and neck-shaft angle formation in children with CP, emphasizing how different gait characteristics can influence bone morphology. This information has potential to explain and eventually prevent or treat the development of bone deformities in CP children.

=520  3\$aMalaria, an illness caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, continues to be a key global health issue; around 40% of the world's population are at risk and more than one million people are killed each year according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). It is transmitted via bites of infected female mosquitoes (Anopheles) and its severest form, falciparum malaria, can lead to death if left untreated. Effective malarial treatment is complex due to drug resistance and socioeconomic issues in many of the most affected areas. An enzyme from the parasite, myristoyl CoA:protein N-myristoyl transferase(NMT), has been identified as a potential target for antimalarial drugs. N-Myristoyltransferase, which catalyses the co-translational transfer of myristic acid to an N-terminal glycine of certain substrate proteins, has been shown to be essential for various pathogens. This thesis demonstrates the design, synthesis and analysis of potential inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum NMT. Approximately 50 inhibitors with systematic variations based on a benzothiazole scaffold have been synthesised. It is known that these benzothiazoles compete with binding of peptide substrate within the NMT enzyme binding cleft. Differences between the peptide binding pockets of P. falciparum and human NMTs were exploited to design effective and selective new antimalarial treatments. The level of inhibition was measured using SPA that monitors the transfer of 3H-labelled myristoyl CoA to the N-terminus of a polypeptide substrate. A plot of enzyme activity as a function of inhibitor concentration gave inhibition curves from which IC50-values were derived. In vitro tests resulted in four hits with improved activity in the low micromolar region against P. falciparum NMT compared to the lead compound. Nevertheless, the inhibitors were not exceptionally selective over Homo sapiens NMT with an IC50 in the low micromolar region also. Selections of the most promising inhibitors have been tested in vivo and considerable reductions in parasitemia were noted.

=520  3\$aGlass polyalkenoate cements (GPCs) are produced from a reaction between fluoroaluminosilicate glass powder with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). These cements are widely used in dentistry as adhesive and tooth restorative materials. During the setting reaction, the Al(IV) changes its coordination number to Al(VI) and crosslink to PAA chains. In the present work, the structure of the glass and the setting reaction of GPCs were studied by ²⁹Si, ³¹P, ¹⁹F and ²⁷Al magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy. The influences of alumina content as well as mixed cation such as Ca/Na and Ca/Sr on the glass structure were studied. The Q structure of the glass changed with the alumina content as the number of neighbouring Al in SiO4 network decreased. The decrease in alumina content also resulted in more disrupted glasses and a higher tendency to undergo amorphous separation and crystallization because there are more Ca cation available to form NBO and F-Ca(n). Furthermore, the influence of substituting sodium for calcium was investigated. The Q structure of the glass was not affected with the addition of Na. It was found that Na penetrates the phosphorus and fluorine environments and forms Na/Capyrophosphate and F-Ca(2)/Na(1) and Al-F-Na(n) species. The effect of Sr substituting for Ca was also studied. It was suggested that Sr may have a little influence on the glass structure due to their similarity in charge to size ratio. The Sr may slightly affect the phosphorus environment due to the difference in field strength of Ca and Sr. In this study, the setting reaction of GPCs was followed by ²⁹Si, ³¹P, ¹⁹F and ²⁷Al MAS-NMR spectroscopy. All GPCs continue to have a pyrophosphate environment of Q1 Al-O-PO33-regardless of the original glass composition. This suggests that the Al(IV) from the Al-O-P bonds are not released from the glass network, thus are not available to crosslink to PAAchains. Therefore, the phosphate content is important for controlling the working and the setting time of GPCs. The conversion of Al(IV) to Al(VI) was determined from the 27Al MAS-NMR data and the Al(VI):Al(IV) + Al(V) ratio was calculated in order to follow the setting reaction of the GPCs. The addition of fluorine in the GPCs was found to enhance the acid attack during the setting reaction. In contrast, it was suggested that Na delays the setting reaction by forming Na polysalts and hence, disrupting the crosslinking of Al3+ to PAA. Although the presence of Sr has little influence on the structure of the glass, the conversion of Al(IV) to Al(VI) is lower for Sr and mixed Ca/Sr cements than Ca cement. The difference is not yet fully understood, but it is suggested that it may be due to the larger size of Sr ions. A commercial GPC, Carbomer? containing fluoroapatite (FAP) designed to remineralise inthe mouth was also studied. This study showed the involvement of the FAP component inthe setting reaction and hence, the amount of FAP available for promoting theremineralisation process decreases. The Al(V) is present in all GPCs regardless of the settingtime. In addition, the participation of Al(VI) from the glass in the setting reaction is not clearbecause both Al(VI) in the glass and in the cement matrix have very similar chemical shift. The present work suggests that there are two sites of Al(IV) after the setting reaction, whichare attributed to the Al(IV) in the original glass and in the degraded layer of the glass. Thereduction of Al-F-Na(n) and Al-F-Ca(n) species after the setting reaction and theunavailability of Al-O-P bonds for acid attack suggest that ion exchange between cations (Naand Sr) with protons from PAA may take place during the setting reaction. All GPCs showsimilar fluorine environments after setting. It was suggested that fluorine maybe bonded toAl in higher coordination states than four. Finally, there is a reconstruction of the silicatenetwork during the setting reaction, as a result of the release of Al3+ and other ions from theglass network. It is assumed that the reconstruction of the silicate network depends on therelease rate of the Al(IV). It is hoped that the improved structural understanding of the glassand the setting reaction of the GPCs obtained during this study will lead to the design of newGPCs for specific applications.

=520  3\$aEmbryonic stem (ES) cells exist in a pluripotent state and have the ability to differentiate into all adult cell types. Numerous molecular mechanisms are responsible for both maintaining pluripotency and directing differentiation. One of these mechanisms is epigenetics, the heritable regulation of gene expression profiles without changes to the underlying DNA sequence. This has recently been the focus of a large amount of research. The Polycomb group (PcG) proteins have been identified as major epigenetic regulators. Recent research has shown that PcG proteins are involved in silencing genes in ES cells which play a key role in development and cell fate decisions. PcG proteins function in two main complexes, the Polycomb repressive complexes (PRC), PRC1 and PRC2. Here I explore the mechanisms involved in the regulation of PcG proteins in ES cells and how these proteins contribute to the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency. Analysis of the expression levels of PRC2 genes showed them to be significantly reduced in differentiated cells compared to undifferentiated ES cells. The differences observed in PRC2 expression are due to a regulation at the transcriptional level by key ES cell transcription factors such as Oct4 and Sox2. Interestingly, ES cell lines which are mutant for PcG members failed to silence genes expressed in distinct lineages of the mouse embryo and show a greater tendency to differentiate. In particular, Ring1A/B proteins from the PRC1 complex were shown to be essential for maintaining a poised form of RNAPII at silenced ES cell promoters, thus contributing to the maintenance of pluripotency in ES cells. Recent data has shown that the Polycomblike protein (Pcl) interacts with the canonical PRC2 complex. To further characterise this interaction I have used an affinity purification strategy to isolate novel Pcl2 complexes from ES cells and identify potential interactors and recruitment factors. The affinity purification of Pcl2 confirmed it to be a bona fide member of a PRC2 sub-complex and identified additional interactor proteins which will be further characterised. The knockdown of Pcl2 does not have a severe impact on the stability of ES cells but affects the recruitment of Ezh2 and Suz12 to the promoters of PRC2 target genes leading to a small reduction on H3K27me3 levels but no changes in gene expression. In addition Pcl2 plays a key role in the recruitment of PRC2 to the inactive X chromosome and enrichment of H3K27me3. These observations suggest that Pcl2 plays an important role in PRC2 mediated epigenetic control.

=520  3\$aThe environmental impact of biodegradable waste has resulted in legislativedrivers that are designed primarily to reduce the impacts arising from (a)pathogens in the waste, (b) gaseous emissions of carbon dioxide and methane,and (c) the effects of biodegradation in landfill sites on leachates to groundwater. These drivers are considered in this research under three applications: (i) thedevelopment of a sustainable technology for the treatment of food wastes to obtaina high quality compost product in a closed-loop situation within a single premises,(ii) the development of a programme to assess the environmental impacts andcarbon footprints of food waste treatment options and of other secondary recoveryprocesses, and (iii) the development of a methodology to assess the effects oflandfill leachate on groundwaters resulting from deleterious landfill practices andmanagement. Technology to overcome the challenges associated with the conversion of foodwaste to compost has been developed. The resulting in-vessel compostingprocess produces a high quality compost that meets the highest BSI PAS 100standard. The key factors in the methodology are the rapid transfer of food wastefrom the kitchen to composter, the efficient maceration and dewatering of thefeedstock, optimisation of the C:N ratio, and the achievement of temperatures highenough to destroy pathogens. The fundamentals of the concept of benchmarking was developed in this work aspart of a study to permit the determination of carbon dioxide savings in secondarymetal recovery, and extended to carbon footprinting of alternative processes tolandfill of food waste to permit a comparison of alternative treatments of foodwaste. The in-vessel composting methodology described in this work comparesfavourably with the alternative methods of food waste treatment. A computer software programme, HEDAS, for the statistical analysis of landfillmonitoring data to predict borehole behaviour, has been developed. Theprogramme permits assessment of the reliability of the data and ultimatelydetermines the extent of groundwater contamination. In the course of thedevelopment of the software, a novel concept was used to determine the bestapplicable experimental standard deviation (BAESD) to be used to assess thereliability of individual borehole and analyte data. The BAESD is used with themeasured standard deviations for individual boreholes and analytes to produce areliability rating for the individual borehole and analyte. These ratings effectivelymeasure the analytical data against the most stable boreholes at the site andprovide viable indicators of step changes in concentration or other anomalies. HEDAS was developed using historical data from the UK Environment Agency?sThames region, and is now used as their standard for assessing monitored data atlandfill sites. The application of HEDAS has now been extended from groundwaterand leachate analysis to landfill gas emissions.

=520  3\$aThe primary objective of this thesis is to explore the relationship between the surfaceand underlying structure of dry foams. This relationship is important for both researchand industry because the surface film size distribution is typically the onlyinformation available in opaque foams when referring to the underlying bubble sizedistribution. This study is carried out by simulating foams with free surfaces. Firstly, the method of simulating 3D dry foams with free surfaces is presented. Thesimulation method is verified for foams with uniform bubble sizes by comparing theirsimulation results to experimental values reported in literature. The validity of themethod and its ability to accurately model the structure of both surface and internalbubbles is demonstrated by the excellent agreement between the experimental studyand the simulation results. Secondly, the simulation results are shown for the relationship between the surfacefilm size distribution and the surface bubble size distribution. The results show that,for a given surface bubble size, there is a distribution of possible surface film sizes. However, for the range of polydispersity used in this thesis, the distribution of theratio of film size to the size of bubble to which it is attached is found to beindependent of the underlying bubble size distribution. A functional form of thisrelationship is obtained by nonlinear regression. Based on the functions obtained, thesurface film size distributions can be computed using the underlying surface bubblesize distribution. This is the inverse of what is acquired and therefore a numericalprocedure for obtaining the surface bubble size distributions using the correspondingsurface film size distribution is developed. This method is demonstrated to accuratelyreproduce the results from the full structural foam simulations.

=520  3\$aA key challenge in combustion research is to model complex turbulence-chemistryinteractions during extinction and re-ignition of non-premixed ames. These arecaused when the scalar dissipation, , is above (or below) certain limits such thatthe diffusive temperature ux from the ame is much larger (or smaller) than chemicalheat-release. is characterised by its small-scale intermittency, i.e. large uctuationsin are frequent and localised in space. This behaviour severely constrainsits resolvability and has implications for modelling extinction/re-ignition processes. Scalar eld statistics from the direct numerical simulation (DNS) database of aspatially-evolving, turbulent jet ame with multi-step chemistry by Pantano (2004)are studied using three different approaches, namely analysis of dissipation-spectra,direct investigation of dissipation contours and spatial filtering of the instantaneousdissipation signals. Out of these the spatial filtering method is found to be mostsuited for capturing the intermittent dissipation length scales and an Re?-1scaling isproposed for adequate -resolution in turbulent jet ame experiments/simulations. Furthermore, a Multiple Mapping Conditioning (MMC) approach with two referencevariables is used to model extinction/re-ignition in inhomogeneous turbulent jetames. A new sub-model for the convective velocity term is employed that does notneed to presume Gaussian statistics and consistent closures for MMC drift and diffusioncoefficients are derived. Effect of temperature uctuations on scalar diffusivityis also accounted for. Joint scalar PDFs, conditional dissipation and conditionalspecies predictions from MMC, and also conditional species concentrations fromconventional singly- and doubly-conditioned moment closure (CMC1 and CMC2),are assessed against the Pantano DNS database. CMC1 expectedly over-predicts extinctionand does not capture re-ignition, whereas extinction and re-ignition effectson species concentrations (including atomic H-radical) are captured satisfactorilyusing CMC2 and MMC. However, MMC scores over CMC2 because models forthe joint scalar PDF evolution and conditional dissipation are self-contained in theformer.

=520  3\$aNeisseria meningitidis is a Gram negative bacterium that commonly colonizes the nasopharyngeal mucosa of 10% of the population at any given time. Infrequently it invades to cause life threatening septicaemia and/or meningitis. I have used microarray technology to study the repertoire of meningococcal gene expression in the course of prolonged incubation in human plasma and blood, with the aim of identifying genes that are progressively up-regulated during sepsis, especially those encoding surface antigens. I hypothesize that any surface exposed gene products that are expressed at a higher level in the bloodstream than on the mucosal surface, where immune selection pressure drives antigenic diversity, should be less variable, and so, attractive as cross-protective vaccine candidates. In my thesis research I explored experimental methods for modelling meningococcal bacteraemia ex vivo. I characterised the transcriptional response of a serogroup B strain of N. meningitidis during prolonged incubation (up to 4 hours) in fresh frozen non-bactericidal plasma from two individuals. Subsequently the meningococcal transcriptome was examined during incubation in fresh, anticoagulated non-bactericidal whole human blood for different periods up to 4 hours, using microarrays and realtime PCR technology. The cellular localisation of proteins encoded by genes confirmed to be significantly differentially expressed in plasma and/or blood, both by microarray technology and by real-time PCR, was explored using bioinformatic resources, and those predicted (or established) to be surface-exposed were brought forward for further evaluation. Amongst these, I selected genes up-regulated in bacteria incubated in plasma and/or blood, but down-regulated (according to data previously obtained) for organisms isolated from an experimental system modelling the nasopharyngeal carriage state, for examination of sequence diversity. Using serogroup B meningococcal strains of established (multi locus sequence type) diversity; I have used direct sequencing to address the starting hypothesis that these are comparatively invariant genes.

=520  3\$aThe thesis is related to laboratory astrophysics, and investigates with this technique,the launching mechanism for young stellar object jets and the interactionof two supernovae remnant in the Sedov-Taylor regime. Recent experiments performedat Imperial College on the pulsed-power magpie facility have successfullyshown the formation of magnetically driven radiatively cooled plasmas jets formedfrom radial wire arrays, which are relevant to studying the launching mechanismsof astrophysical jets [A. Ciardi, et al. Phys. Plasmas 14, p056501 (2007)]. Theexperiments have been now extended to study episodic mass ejection ( 25 ns [F.A. Suzuki-Vidal, et al. 49th Annual Meeting of the Division of Plasma Physics,UO4.00007 (2007)]) and the interaction of jets and magnetic bubbles with an ambientgas. The dynamics of the interaction is investigated through three-dimensionalresistive magneto-hydrodynamic simulations using the code gorgon [A. Ciardi, etal. Phys. Plasmas 14, p056501 (2007) ? J.P. Chittenden, et al. Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 46 B457 (2004)]. In particular ablation of the cathode is investigatednumerically to explain the periodicity and subsequent formation of multiple bubbles. Comparison with experiments is offered to validate the results. The complexstructure of the magnetic field is investigated, the conservation of the magnetic fluxis explained and the consequent confinement offered to the central jet. Furthermorethe interaction of the plasma outflows with an ambient gas is investigated. The formationof shocks in the ambient gas, as well as the formation of three-dimensionalMach stems is analyzed. In addition, recent experiment at Imperial College performedby the QOLS group, by laser-heating a medium of atomic clusters [R. A.Smith, et al. 2007 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 49 B117-B124 (2007)], shows the capability to create plasmas with sufficiently high energy densities to launch strongshocks. Interactions between high-Mach number shock waves are believed to beresponsible for many of the complex, turbulent structures seen in astrophysical objectsincluding supernova remnants. The experiment of two colliding Sedov-Taylorregime blast-waves is modelled. Detailed 3D numerical modeling is performed inorder to study the importance of thermal conduction, rarefaction waves, refractiveshock waves and complex three-dimensional mach stem formation. The simulateddata are benchmark against a three-dimensional tomography image (newly developedexperimental technique). The collision of two blast-waves should reproducethe non uniform interstellar medium where supernovas normally expand.

=520  3\$aStroke in general but especially in the postoperative period is a serious clinical problem that warrants new therapeutic approaches. Here neuroprotective strategies and especially preconditioning have recently emerged as promising. Preconditioning was originally demonstrated in the heart but was subsequently also found in other organs. Classically it describes a phenomenon where short periods of ischaemia render tissues less vulnerable to major infarcts. In addition to ischaemia neuronal preconditioning can be achieved pharmacologically as well as through inhalational anaesthetics or drugs that open ATP-sensitive K+(KATP)channels. However, the mechanisms through which anaesthetics produce protection remain elusive and the use of K+ channel openers is hampered by their inability to cross the blood-brain-barrier. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of inhalational anaesthetics on KATP channels and to explore whether their neuronal preconditioning properties were dependent on KATP channel opening. First, in whole-cell and excised patch clamp experiments the effects of inhalational anaesthetics on recombinant wild type neuronal (Kir6.2/SUR1) KATP and related as well as modified channels were evaluated. Secondly, the KATP channel dependence of anaesthetic preconditioning was tested in neuronal-glial co-cultures. Recombinant KATP channels were activated by xenon, but inhibited by halogenated volatiles. Moreover, it was shown that xenon acted directly on the Kir6.2 pore-forming subunit, reduced the ability of ATP to inhibit the channel and had no effect on the ATP-regulated Kir1.1 channel. Functionally both sevoflurane and xenon preconditioned neurons at clinically used concentrations but only the effect of xenon was dependent on KATP channel activation. Thus this study established xenon as a novel KATP channel opener. It interacts with the pore-forming Kir6.2 rather than the regulatory sulphonyl urea receptor subunit and disinhibits the channel from the blocking actions of ATP. As a consequence xenon but not sevoflurane is able to precondition neurons in a KATP channel-dependent manner.

=520  3\$aDiffusion-weighted imaging of small animals at high field strengths is a challenging prospect due to its extreme sensitivity to motion. Periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (PROPELLER) was introduced at 9.4T as an imaging method that is robust to motion and distortion. Proton density (PD)-weighted and T2-weighted PROPELLER data were generally superior to that acquired with single-shot, Cartesian and echo planar imaging-based methods in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio and resistance to artifacts. Simulations and experiments revealed that PROPELLER image quality was dependent on the field strength and echo times specified. In particular, PD-weighted imaging at high field led to artifacts that reduced image contrast. In PROPELLER, data are acquired in progressively rotated blades in k-space and combined on a Cartesian grid. PROPELLER with echo truncation at low spatial frequencies (PETALS) was conceived as a post-processing method that improved contrast by reducing the overlap of k-space data from different blades with different echo times. Where the addition of diffusion weighting gradients typically leads to catastrophic motion artifacts in multi-shot sequences, diffusion-weighted PROPELLER enabled the acquisition of high quality, motion-robust data. Applications in the healthy mouse brain and abdomen at 9.4T and in stroke patients at 3T are presented. PROPELLER increases the minimum scan time by approximately 50%. Consequently, methods were explored to reduce the acquisition time. Two k-space undersampling regimes were investigated by examining image fidelity as a function of degree of undersampling. Undersampling by acquiring fewer k-space blades was shown to be more robust to motion and artifacts than undersampling by expanding the distance between successive phase encoding steps. To improve the consistency of undersampled data, the non-uniform fast Fourier transform was employed. It was found that acceleration factors of up to two could be used with minimal visual impact on image fidelity. To reduce the number of scans required for isotropic diffusion weighting, the use of rotating diffusion gradients was investigated, exploiting the rotational symmetry of the PROPELLER acquisition. Fixing the diffusion weighting direction to the individual rotating blades yielded geometry and anisotropy-dependent diffusion measurements. However, alternating the orientations of diffusion weighting with successive blades led to more accurate measurements of the apparent diffusion coefficient while halving the overall acquisition time. Optimized strategies are proposed for the use of PROPELLER in rapid high resolution imaging at high field strength.

=520  3\$aMultiple System Atrophy (MSA) and Pure Autonomic Failure (PAF) are contrasting models of Chronic Autonomic failure. PAF primarily involves the post-ganglionic autonomic nervous system, whilst in MSA the pre-ganglionic structures are impaired. My central hypothesis is that this underlying neuropathological difference between MSA and PAF will lead to differing cardiovascular responses. I will assess the cardiovascular effects of known pressor and vasomotor stimuli (mental arithmetic, cold pressor test, isometric exercise, water ingestion, inhaled CO₂ and inspiratory gasp) in MSA and PAF. Neurohormonal aspects will be explored by comparing the cardiovascular effects of the α2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine with serum noradrenaline levels in these groups, as well as comparing supine antidiuretic hormone (ADH) levels after head up tilt and correlating these with supine blood pressure (BP). As well as contrasting the cardiovascular responses, I will use the water ingestion studies to examine effects on orthostatic hypotension, a common complication of both MSA and PAF. To measure cardiovascular responses during these studies I have used the Portapres II device to obtain continuous, non-invasive, beat-to-beat measurements of BP and heart rate (HR). Subsequent Model flow analysis using Beatscope software has then been used to calculate further cardiovascular indices, including cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and total peripheral resistance (TPR). In addition, intermittent BP and HR measurements have been obtained with an automated sphygmomanometer (Dinamap). Finally, peripheral vasomotor responses have been recorded by means of the Laser Doppler perfusion meter.

=520  3\$aIn response to the challenge of proposed reductions to greenhouse gas emissionsoutlined in international agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol, countries areconsidering supplying a significant share of their future energy requirements fromrenewable energy sources. Wind power, both on and offshore, is the principalcommercially available and scaleable renewable energy technology. It is expected toremain the dominant technology in the medium-term future by delivering the majorityof the required growth in renewable energy. The unique characteristics of wind power generation raise issues for its integration intothe existing power systems. This thesis explores three specific issues, namely, windgeneration?s limited capacity value, its remoteness from demand centres and theappropriateness of the regulatory framework governing its integration. The first issue was addressed by examining how the presence of flexible generationsources like hydro power affects the capacity value of wind in an assessment of overallsystem generation capacity. Wind capacity credit is interpreted from a planningperspective, and also as a component of the economic value of wind. The resultsillustrate that hydro power can compensate the variability of wind generation therebyaugmenting its capacity value. The second issue required the development of a transmission planning methodology toevaluate the sufficiency of transmission network capacity to accommodate windgeneration and to manage security of supply. The methodology was used to assess, overthe long term investment horizon, the requirement for additional transmission networkcapacity driven by wind generation. The assessment found that wind generation drivesless transmission network capacity than conventional generation and that wind andconventional generation should share the same transmission network capacity. Finally, the thesis looked into the establishment of regulatory framework that couldrecognise the realistic contribution of wind generation characteristics to transmissionsecurity and capture this contribution within the network pricing structure. The current 4transmission security standards were reviewed to evaluate whether they are capable ofrecognising the different operation characteristics and output of wind generation. Standards for assessing transmission adequacy were found to lead to under-investmentin capacity for importing areas and over-investment in exporting areas. Consequently, aset of ?contribution factors? capturing the interaction between wind and systemcharacteristics were derived to augment the standards. At the same time, a modificationof the present TNUoS charging mechanism in order to discriminate between generationtechnology types and to devise cost-reflective pricing regimes is proposed. This isparticularly important when transmission investment is driven by reliability, as inexporting areas the cost reflective charges for wind were uniformly found to be lowerthan the charges for conventional generators.

=520  3\$aPancreatic Duodenum Homeobox (PDX-1) is a homeodomain transcription factor and akey regulator of β-cell development and differentiation. In mice and humans, mutations of the Pdx1 gene in β-cells have been linked to MODY and type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the regulation of PDX-1 transcriptional activity is very important. Phosphorylation is known to be a pivotal regulatory mechanism for several transcription factors. Therefore in this study, I focused on the regulation of phosphorylation on PDX-1 in intact β-cells and investigated the potential signalling pathways involved in its regulation. Firstly I showed that PDX-1 is phosphorylated under physiological conditions in pancreatic β-cell line. Additionally, recombinant PDX-1 is efficiently phosphorylated in vitro at Thr-152 in the homeodomain by the nutrient-regulated protein kinase, PASK. To explore the physiological relevance of this site I made dephospho- (T152A) and phosphomimetic (T152E) mutants of PDX-1. In INSrαβ cells, a less differentiated cell line derived from INS-1 cells, wild-type PDX-1 and PDX-1T152A were partially redistributed from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to elevated glucose concentrations (20 vs 3 mM). By contrast, PDX-1T152D and PDX-1T152E displayed enhanced nuclear immunoreactivity at low glucose concentrations, and underwent nuclear export as glucose concentrations were raised. PDX-1 binding to an oligonucleotide based on the consensus A3 binding site of the preproinsulin gene promoter was completely abolished by mutation of Thr-152 to an acidic amino acid. Furthermore, the PDX-1 phosphomimetic mutants failed to suppress preproglucagon gene expression in INSrαβ cells, an action fully preserved in the T152A mutant. However, metabolic labelling of INS-1(832/13) cells with 32Pi, as well as mass spectroscopic analysis,and the use of a phospho Thr-152-specific antibody, failed to reveal any clear evidence for phosphorylation at this site under a variety of in vivo conditions, including in cells overexpressing PASK. Thus, Thr-152 is not a major site of phosphorylation of PDX-1 in intact β-cells. However, a novel phosphorylation site, Ser-269, at the C-terminus of PDX-1 was identified by mass spectrometry. To explore the potential upstream regulatory kinase and the signalling pathway involved, I generated dephospho-(S269A) and phosphomimetic(S269E) mutant PDX-1 and a phospho-Ser-269-specific antibody. Candidate kinases were also identified using recombinant wild-type and mutant PDX-1 in in vitro phosphorylation experiments. In this thesis I demonstrate that PDX-1 is phosphorylated under physiological conditions in β-cell lines. I have shown that Thr152 is not a major phosphorylation site of PDX-1 in intact cells and we also defined the novel in vivo phosphorylation site of PDX-1. Moreover, we reported that PDX-1 is phosphorylated in vitro by a number of kinases including Aurora, Rsk1, PKCa, JNK. The work presented in the thesis provides evidence that PDX-1 phosphorylation is important in its role as a transcription regulator in mature β-cells; moreover, it suggests several physiological signalling networks to investigate.

=520  3\$aThis study provides a conceptual framework of the combined actions of various groups of stakeholders to account for a new field of institutional emergence: technology-centred institutional emergence. The aim is to gain better understanding of the process of the coinstitutional and industrial emergence of a new technology. Rather than focusing on a particular group of stakeholders, the institutional entrepreneurial 'heroes', the chosen perspective is to provide evidence that institutional entrepreneurship is a complex process which results from a multifaceted web of interactions. By focusing on the particular empirical case of the co-industrial and institutional emergence of nanotechnology, it reveals some of the characteristics of this process. The empirical field of nanotechnology is the nexus of a whole range of technical, economic and social activities and is at the core of much debate relating to ethics, regulation, economics and politics. Therefore it constitutes an excellent domain of research to enable the replicability of the findings. The scope of the study is global, with a particular focus on Europe and the United States. In this research, I draw mainly from the theoretical frameworks of new institutionalism and entrepreneurship. New institutionalism claims that institutions operate in an environment consisting of other institutions which influence them and that to survive in such an environment, organisations need to establish legitimacy within the world of institutions. The establishment of legitimacy is at the heart of this research and I show that in the field of nanotechnology ventures, institutional legitimacy arises from close interactions between entrepreneurship and institutional entrepreneurship. Building on this conceptual framework I show that: • The process of nanotechnology institutional emergence is co-evolutionary with that of industrial emergence. • Institutional emergence in nanotechnologies results from a specific web of interactions where increasing awareness of the importance of sustainable development constitutes an overlapping area of the distinct visions of each group of stakeholders and may be seen as the connecting element which keeps otherwise potentially diverging agendas together. My demonstration rests on a model which postulates that nanotechnology institutional emergence results from the combined interactions of mainly five groups of stakeholders: entrepreneurs, commentators, end users, scientists and policy makers.

=520  3\$aStructure and chemical composition of InAs/GaAs quantum dots and GaInNAs/GaAs quantum wells were investigated using analytical transmission electron microscopy. These material systems are of importance for fabricating optoelectronic devices capable of operating in the 1.3 - 1.55 μm wavelength range. The samples were grown by molecular beam epitaxy. The optical properties of the quantum dots and quantum wells are largely determined by their structure and composition. Properties such as the shape, size and composition of the InAs/GaAs quantum dots and the morphology and composition of the GaInNAs/GaAs quantum wells were studied using high angle annular dark field imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. In the case of the InAs/GaAs quantum dots, in particular, the effects of the GaAs spacer layer thickness in bilayer quantum dots and overgrowing the quantum dots with GaInAs instead of GaAs on the properties of the dots were investigated. The results indicated that the GaAs spacer layer can have a significant influence on the shape, size and nucleation position of the quantum dots in the second layer. In addition to this, it was demonstrated that overgrowing the quantum dots with GaInAs instead of GaAs introduces smaller changes to the structure and composition of the dots. In case of the quantum wells, the influence of the growth temperature and In composition on their morphology and composition were examined. Higher growth temperatures and In contents were shown to lead to the degradation of the 2D morphology and formation of inhomogeneities in the chemical composition of the quantum wells. When correlated with the optical performance of these structures, these results can provide important information about their structure-property relationships. Finally, the possibility of utilising electron energy-loss spectroscopy in monochromated transmission electron microscopy instruments to measure and map the band gap of semiconductor structures was studied and the results discussed.

=520  3\$aAs the increasing popularity of integrating hands-free telephony on mobile portable devicesand the rapid development of voice over internet protocol, identification of acousticsystems has become desirable for compensating distortions introduced to speech signalsduring transmission, and hence enhancing the speech quality. The objective of this researchis to develop system identification algorithms for speech enhancement applicationsincluding network echo cancellation and speech dereverberation. A supervised adaptive algorithm for sparse system identification is developed fornetwork echo cancellation. Based on the framework of selective-tap updating schemeon the normalized least mean squares algorithm, the MMax and sparse partial updatetap-selection strategies are exploited in the frequency domain to achieve fast convergenceperformance with low computational complexity. Through demonstrating howthe sparseness of the network impulse response varies in the transformed domain, themultidelay filtering structure is incorporated to reduce the algorithmic delay. Blind identification of SIMO acoustic systems for speech dereverberation in thepresence of common zeros is then investigated. First, the problem of common zeros isdefined and extended to include the presence of near-common zeros. Two clustering algorithmsare developed to quantify the number of these zeros so as to facilitate the studyof their effect on blind system identification and speech dereverberation. To mitigate sucheffect, two algorithms are developed where the two-stage algorithm based on channeldecomposition identifies common and non-common zeros sequentially; and the forcedspectral diversity approach combines spectral shaping filters and channel undermodellingfor deriving a modified system that leads to an improved dereverberation performance. Additionally, a solution to the scale factor ambiguity problem in subband-based blind system identification is developed, which motivates further research on subbandbaseddereverberation techniques. Comprehensive simulations and discussions demonstratethe effectiveness of the aforementioned algorithms. A discussion on possible directionsof prospective research on system identification techniques concludes this thesis.

=520  3\$aRecent and future changes in land use policy, economic environment, land ownership and an increasing emphasis on countryside stewardship means land management in the UK countryside is and will continue to change. Land management practices influence landscape, habitat availability and species distributions, which affect societal welfare estimates for the British countryside. This thesis compares elements of socio-economic and ecological value for the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), an upland area of acknowledged conservation importance. The area is composed of privately owned estates, and management is centred on red grouse shooting and upland sheep farming. The aim of this thesis is to compare different elements of conservation related value, and investigate how potential future land use/funding scenarios might ultimately influence these values. Stakeholders (landowners, red grouse shooting tenants and farming tenants) have differential motivations, and not all are motivated primarily for profits. Estates are classified into two types: those with commercially driven red grouse shooting, and those without. Profits are shown to vary across estates and be negative for many. The commercially driven estates, along with tenant farmers, are likely to embrace conservation if subsidised by government. Approximately twenty percent of the non-commercial estates essentially pay for conservation management, with two estates in particular paying farmers for conservation management. Others may come into conflict with conservation where it is not reconciled with red grouse shooting. Recent advances in habitat suitability modelling allowed presence only data to be used to predict the distribution of Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) species. This technique proved useful and reliable even with small sample sizes, and as expected, each BAP species has different requirements. Agri-environment schemes are shown to be beneficial to 7/15 BAP species, although are detrimental to 2/5 vertebrate BAP species, suggesting that with some attention to vertebrates they can be a strong force for conservation. Contingent valuation was the method chosen to estimate the utility provided by the landscape and biodiversity of the North Pennines. When visitors to the area were surveyed, landscape and biodiversity were both found to be important in preference formation, and significant negative valuations were elicited. Visitors were prepared to pay an average of ?10.52 per household annually for the preferred outcome, and an average of ?4.22 to prevent the least preferred outcome. A mosaic landscape with increases in blanket bog and the associated increases in rare and threatened birds and mammals (the cute and cuddly effect) was highly valued by respondents. A framework for incorporating these multiple elements of value was presented, allowing the impacts of potential policy scenarios to be demonstrated, via stakeholder reactions. As well as demonstrating a lack of holistic policy proposals, this model made it clear that a decline in the extent of red grouse shooting would represent a cost to society. This thesis showed how to combine multiple elements of value to assess the wider impacts of potential future policies and economic conditions in an upland case study area, and makes suggestions for incorporating further values into this framework.

=520  3\$aOne of the main cues we use in our everyday life when interacting with the environment is shape. For example, we use shape information to recognise a chair, grasp a cup, perceive traffic signs andsolve jigsaw puzzles. We also use shape when dealing with more sophisticated tasks, such as themedical diagnosis of radiographs or the restoration of archaeological artifacts. While the perceptionof shape and its use is a natural ability of human beings, endowing machines with such skills isnot straightforward. However, the exploitation of shape cues is important for the development ofcompetent computer methods that will automatically perform tasks such as those just mentioned. With this aim, the present work proposes computer methods which use shape to tackle two importanttasks, namely packing and object recognition. The packing problem arises in a variety of applications in industry, where the placement of a setof two-dimensional shapes on a surface such that no shapes overlap and the uncovered surface areais minimised is important. Given that this problem is NP-complete, we propose a heuristic methodwhich searches for a solution of good quality, though not necessarily the optimal one, within a reasonablecomputation time. The proposed method adopts a pictorial representation and employs a greedyalgorithm which uses a shape matching module in order to dynamically select the order and the poseof the parts to be placed based on the ?gaps? appearing in the layout during the execution. This thesis further investigates shape matching in the context of object recognition and first considersthe case where the target object and the input scene are represented by their silhouettes. Two distinctmethods are proposed; the first method follows a local string matching approach, while the secondone adopts a global optimisation approach using dynamic programming. Their use of silhouettes,however, rules out the consideration of any internal contours that might appear in the input scene,and in order to address this limitation, we later propose a graph-based scheme that performs shapematching incorporating information from both internal and external contours. Finally, we lift the assumptionmade that input data are available in the form of closed curves, and present a method whichcan robustly perform object recognition using curve fragments (edges) as input evidence. Experimentsconducted with synthetic and real images, involving rigid and deformable objects, show therobustness of the proposed methods with respect to geometrical transformations, heavy clutter andsubstantial occlusion.

=520  3\$aBackground & Introduction: Heart transplantation is the most effective treatment for end-stage heart failure (HF) but is hindered due to an inadequate availability of donor organs. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) have been shown to be a suitable alternative and primarily used as a 'bridge to transplantation' wherein the failing heart can be supported by mechanical circulatory assistance until a suitable donor organ becomes available. In 4-9% of patients, the LVAD also acts as 'bridge to recovery', since it induces substantial functional improvement that allows LVAD explantation, without the need of transplantation. The rate for explantation of the LVAD remains low and the functional improvement observed, a transient phenomenon. LVADs cause mechanical unloading, which produces functional, structural, signalling and molecular changes in HF. Development of myocardial unloading-induced atrophy, time-dependent myocyte contractile dysfunction and excitation-contraction (EC) coupling changes may have detrimental consequences. However, when mechanical unloading is combined with pharmacological therapy, including the β2-AR agonist clenbuterol, an improved 'bridge to recovery' rate of 75% can be achieved. The effects of clenbuterol on functional, structural, signalling and molecular changes in normal and failing hearts, during mechanical unloading, are unknown. This thesis investigates some of the key effects of mechanical unloading and β2-AR agonist stimulation with clenbuterol for HF treatment, based on the following hypotheses which have been individually addressed in Chapters 3, 4 and 5 respectively. (i) Chronic administration of clenbuterol alters myocardial structure and function and affects calcium handling in normal rat hearts; (ii) Mechanical left ventricular unloading and the consequent left ventricular atrophy results in altered whole-heart and cellular function in non-failing/normal rat hearts; (iii) Clenbuterol treatment during mechanical unloading of a normal rat heart normalises whole-heart and cellular function; (iv) Clenbuterol has an additional benefit when combined with mechanical unloading in the treatment of failing rat hearts. Methods: Clenbuterol was administered by osmotic minipumps. Mechanical unloading was achieved by heterotopic abdominal heart transplantation. Heart failure was induced by left coronary artery ligation in rats. In-vivo whole heart function was assessed by echocardiography and ex-vivo function by pressure-volume relationship. Only LV myocytes were isolated and studied using optical, fluorescence and electrophysiological techniques. Calcium handling protein expression was assessed by Western blotting. Theory and methodology of the single-cell studies is outlined, together with validation experiments and the necessary assumptions. Results: Data obtained and their interpretations are presented in three chapters according to the proposed hypotheses. The results show that clenbuterol with, without mechanical unloading, or on its own can affect both whole-heart and cellular function in normal hearts. The treatment of failing hearts with clenbuterol, alone or in combination with mechanical unloading, improves LV function at whole-heart and cellular level by effects on cell morphology, EC coupling and myofilament sensitivity to calcium. The details of individual experiments and their interpretation are discussed in the respective chapter. General Discussion: This thesis supports the use of clenbuterol in the strategy to improve recovery in HF patients treated with LVADs and also begins to elucidate some of the possible cellular mechanisms responsible for the improvement in LV function. The questions remaining unanswered are discussed and possible future experiments that could be performed to address them are described.

=520  3\$aThe pericellular matrix (PCM) is a distinct zone of matrix that surrounds individual chondrocytes throughout articular cartilage. Although not much is known about its function, our group has shown that it has a role in mechanotransduction by controlling the bioavailability of perlecan-bound FGF-2. The aim of this project was to determine the other structural components of the PCM, and to search for other heparin binding growth factors which might be sequestered in the matrix. By confocal microscopy I confirmed that the PCM was rich in type VI collagen and perlecan, although devoid of type II collagen and aggrecan. Isolation of individual chondrons (the chondrocyte together with its PCM) was performed by partial digestion of the matrix using dispase and collagenase, and proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry was performed to identify new proteins. As this method was only partially successful I looked for the presence of a known heparin binding growth factor, connective tissue growth factor (CCN2), in chondron preparations. CCN2, which is an abundant secreted protein of articular cartilage, was present in both the chondron preparation by western blot, and was visualised in the PCM of porcine and human articular cartilage by confocal microscopy. CCN2 is not commercially available so His-tagged recombinant protein was stably expressed and purified using nickel affinity chromatography. Biological activity of the purified protein was investigated in a number of established assays. No biological activity was demonstrated when purified CCN2 was used alone on murine mesenchymal stem cells, but was evident when assayed in combination with low dose TGF-β. The effect of exogenous CCN2 on fibroblasts was limited by the significant release of endogenous CCN2. High constitutive expression of CCN2 in articular cartilage may limit the effects seen by exogenous CCN2. However, the results presented in this thesis support the role of CCN2 as a modulator of TGF beta signalling, and suggest that, through potentiating TGF beta it may regulate matrix turnover in articular cartilage.

=520  3\$aIn England, the loss of lowland heathland, a habitat of high conservationimportance, is primarily due to the invasion of birch and pine. This secondarysuccession has been researched in depth from a plant perspective but little is knownabout the role of mycorrhizal fungi, even though both trees and heather aremycorrhizal. In fact, tree encroachment onto lowland heathland can be regarded asthe replacement of a resident ericoid mycorrhizal community by an invadingectomycorrhizal community. I determined the identity and distribution of the ectomycorrhizal fungiassociated with birch and pine encroachment onto lowland heathlands. Iestablished whether there are mycorrhizal fungi that mediate the invasion by a)comparing the mycorrhizal inoculum potential of soil and ectomycorrhizal fungaldiversity at three levels of invasion (uninvaded heathland, invaded heathland andwoodland), b) comparing the fungi forming mycorrhizas on tree seedlings and treesacross diverse sites, c) determining the effect of proximity to trees onmycorrhization and seedling biomass, and d) identifying fungal dispersal methods. I established that in lowland heathlands i) seedlings have limited access toectomycorrhizal fungi even within sapling rooting zones, ii) ectomycorrhizalinoculum potential increases as the level of tree invasion increases, iii) mycorrhizalseedlings accumulate more biomass than non-mycorrhizal seedlings, iv) there arefive keystone ectomycorrhizal fungi that participate in tree invasion - Rhizopogonluteolus, Suillus bovinus, S. variegatus (pine symbionts), Laccaria proxima andThelephora terrestris (primarily birch symbionts), v) some ectomycorrhizal fungicannot colonise seedlings via spores, and vi) ectomycorrhizal communities differbetween lowland heathland sites. This study is the first to identify the mycorrhizal fungi that associate withtree seedlings on lowland heathlands and it is one of the first biome-levelmycorrhizal studies of secondary plant succession. The data presented provide thestepping-stones required for future ecologically-relevant modelling andexperimentation aimed at understanding mycorrhizal invasions.

=520  3\$aThis thesis discusses the development of novel multi-dimensional fluorescence microscopy, particularly fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) technology, and its application to imaging Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) events in live cells. Particular emphasis is placed on imaging activation of Ras family GTP-ases and binding to their effectors, including Phospholipase C Epsilon (PLCe). The early part of the thesis discusses FLIM-FRET experiments performed using a standard confocal microscope with time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) to image interactions between PLCe and Ras. These early experiments suggested a weak interaction but this mode of imaging was too slow to capture dynamics of Ras activation in live cells. The long acquisition times required by the TCSPC microscope prompted the development of a high speed FLIM microscope using wide-field time-gated imaging, which was combined with a Nipkow disc confocal scan head to achieve optical sectioning. This system was characterised and its performance compared with commercially available TCSPC FLIM microscopes, demonstrating the enhancement in imaging speed for comparable accuracy of lifetime determination. This new microscope was subsequently applied to study the activation of the H-Ras oncogene in live cells following EGF stimulation. The latter part of the thesis discusses the development of a second novel microscope system for multiplexed FRET studies - using both FLIM and spectral ratiometric imaging to monitor two different FRET pairs expressed within a single live cell. A CFP-YFP cameleon FRET biosensor was used to probe calcium signals in cells expressing different PLC isoforms and this was complemented by several novel Ras activation sensors that were designed using fluorescent proteins in the red end of the visible spectrum. Calibration experiments were carried out to determine the optimal fluorophores and filter sets for imaging multiplexed biosensors and the potential for imaging dynamics of calcium flux and Ras activation within the same cell were investigated.

=520  3\$aLong-term survivorship of a total knee replacement (TKR) relies on the strength of bone around the implant and its initial stability. Aseptic component loosening caused by mechanical factors is a recognised failure mode for knee prostheses. Bone resorption due to 'stress-shielding' of the stiff stemmed implants will potentially lead to weakened bone strength, and presents a challenge for revision TKR surgery. The aim of this study was to develop analytical methodologies for the investigation of fixation performance of TKR, and to gain a better understanding of the prosthetic design requirements, addressing two major mechanical problems of bone remodelling and aseptic loosening. Patient-specific finite element (FE) modelling incorporated with a strain-adaptive bone remodelling theory was used to simulate bone remodelling responses of the post-operative tibial fixation. The choice of cementing technique was found to influence the remodelling behaviour; cemented fixation - modelled as a firm anchorage of the prosthesis onto the bone, was predicted to induce greater stress-shielding effect consequently leading to severe proximal bone resorption; for a fixation relying on biological attachment of bony ingrowth - modelled as a less firmly anchored bone prosthesis interface, lesser proximal bone resorption was predicted. The consideration of bone remodelling in FE simulations for fixation analyses is paramount as it influenced the risk prediction of aseptic loosening between prosthesis designs. The cement tensile stresses and bone-prosthesis interface micromotions predicted were different prior to and after bone adaptation. FE predictions of the MIS mini-keel and standard stemmed prosthesis fixations after simulating six months of bone adaptation correlated well with the RSA measurements at a similar period. A modified in-vitro technique of measuring bone-prosthesis relative micromotion was developed for relating initial stability of the cemented and cementless (press-fit) tibial prostheses fixations to late aseptic loosening. The developed computational and in vitro methods should be applicable to other joint replacements.

=520  3\$aThis thesis presents experimental and theoretical results on the interaction of high-intensitylasers with solid and gaseous targets. All the measurements that are described belong tothe optical region of the spectrum. The interaction with solid targets has been investigated for two different intensity regimes. Intensities of up to 10[21] Wcm-2 have been accessed on the VULCAN lasersystem at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory whereas the JETI laser system at the Institutf?r Optik und Quantenelektronik in Jena allowed to reach intensities of up to 4x10[19]Wcm-2 . For both regimes, the transport of relativistic electrons generated in the interactionshas been investigated through measurements of the optical radiation emitted fromthe rear surface of the solid targets. Polarimetry and angular distribution measurementsindicate that the radiation presents a high degree of polarisation and is non-isotropicallyemitted. It is, therefore, mainly attributed to transition radiation. A theoretical modelhas been developed in order to interpret and validate the experimental observations. As aresult, for the high intensity regime variation of the signal strength of the transition radiationwith respect to the direction of observation is attributed to the presence of mm-scalefilaments. The interaction with gaseous targets has been investigated at the Astra Gemini facilityat the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, for peak intensities of up to 3x10[19] Wcm-2 ina spot size of 20 [Mu]m FWHM. In this experiment the properties of the laser pulse werestudied after interaction with the targets. For this purpose, a second harmonic generationFROG device was used. This allowed to determine both the pulse duration and thetemporal phase of the pulse, giving an insight on the dependence of the pulse propertieswith respect to interaction length and electron number density. The experimental resultsshow that the nonlinear evolution of the pulse can lead to compression from 45 fs beforethe interaction to a single pulse of below 20 fs duration, after propagating in the gaseousmedium.

=520  3\$aDynamical systems occur in many areas of science, especially fluid dynamics. One is ofteninterested in examining the structural changes in dynamical systems, and these are oftenrelated to the appearance or disappearance of solution trajectories connecting one or morestationary points. Homoclinic orbits are trajectories that connect a hyperbolic saddle-typestationary point to itself, and often arise as the limiting case of periodic solutions. In globalbifurcation analysis, the occurrence of homoclinic orbits is closely tied to chaotic behaviourin dynamical systems. Numerical computation of homoclinic orbits requires solving a boundary value problem(BVP) over a doubly infinite interval. There are three ways that this can be done. Thefirst is to truncate the problem to a large finite interval and create appropriate projectedboundary conditions to ensure that the solution over the infinite interval is approximatedwell. The second is to transform the problem to one over a finite interval via an exponentialchange of independent variable. The third is to use a method appropriate for an infiniteinterval by discretising the problem using a set of approximating functions appropriate toan infinite interval. In this thesis we will compare algorithms of all three types, and test ourimplementations of them on several test problems.? The first algorithm we will examine will be the original time method of Beyn. Thismethod truncates the infinite interval to a finite one, and produces projected boundaryconditions that force the endpoints of the trajectory to lie in the appropriate invariantsubspaces of the stationary point. This algorithm also includes a method for determiningwhether or not the truncated interval is large enough to obtain a solutionaccurate to a required tolerance.? The second algorithm is called time + subspace, and is a variation on the originaltime method that fixes the distance between the stationary point and the endpointof the solution, but allows the interval to vary ? the reverse of which was true fororiginal time.? The third algorithm is of the second type and is based upon the arclength parameterisationof the orbits. This method uses the arclength of the trajectory as the independentvariable to transform the problem to a finite interval. However, the BVPformulated in this way can have a singularity at the end of the domain, and thus aspecial collocation method is required to handle this.? As this method does not perform well on orbits exhibiting ? Silnikov behaviour, avariation of this method called the partial arclength method which uses a differentexponential transformation of the independent variable near the stationary point ispresented to address the deficiency.? The final algorithm presented in this thesis uses Laguerre polynomials to computepoints on the stable and unstable manifolds of the stationary point by solving a BVPover a semi-infinite interval. These are then used to produce boundary conditions forthe truncated BVP that ensure that the endpoints are on the appropriate manifold andnot just the appropriate subspace.

=520  3\$aMany different regions of the brain are involved in appetite control. A full understandingof their function and interaction requires studying neuronal activity at high resolutionsimultaneously in space and time. Two Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) methods canpotentially achieve this goal. Manganese-Enhanced (MEMRI) uses the accumulation ofadministered Mn[2+], which is paramagnetic (hence MRI visible) and taken up by active neuronsthrough voltage-gated Ca[2+] channels during action potentials. Haemodynamic methods use oneor more of many MRI-visible changes that occur to circulating blood in a brain region when itchanges activity. These include blood-oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) and cerebral bloodvolume weighted (CBV) MRI. The aim of this project was to further develop, adapt and then usethese methods to study the effects on neuronal activity of stimuli related to appetite and energybalance. The majority of work went towards adapting MEMRI for this. Amongst many testedchanges, improvements were made to the MRI acquisition protocol (specifically using fast spinecho rather than spin-echo acquisition) to make it more sensitive to Mn-induced signal changes,increase spatial coverage from partial to whole brain and rostro-caudal spatial resolution from1 to 0.4mm, all while maintaining the same temporal resolution. Most importantly, theneuroimaging analysis framework used in haemodynamic functional MRI was adapted foruse with MEMRI. This included the adaptation of spatial normalization software to handleMn-sensitive T[1]-weighted images dominated by non-brain tissue rather than brain dominatedT[2]/T*[2]-weighted images, and the generation of a signal change model for use in GLM. Thisenabled much more objective, reproducible and less laborious data analysis than with previoushand drawn ROIs. Attempts were made to use BOLD- and CBV-fMRI to study the effectsof potent, appetite-modulating gut hormones on appetite, though these failed to produce aresponse.

=520  3\$aThis thesis concerns gene 176R from camelpox virus (CMLV) that encodes a protein known as viral schlafen (v-slfn). v-slfn has an N-terminal domain related to the p26 protein from baculovirus and a C-terminal domain related to mammalian schlafen proteins. A full length v-slfn is expressed by all sequenced orthopox viruses except vaccinia virus (VACV) and variola virus. The baculovirus p26 proteins are poorly characterised, with no known function. In contrast, murine schlafen (m-slfn) proteins are upregulated in response to infection and the promoter for m-slfn2 has NF-κB and AP-1 binding sites. The prototypic slfn, m-slfn1, halts cellular proliferation by inhibition of cyclin D1 expression in vitro and both m-slfn1 and m-slfn8 reduce thymocyte proliferation in vivo. v-slfn is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein of 57 kDa that is expressed both early and late during CMLV infection. Expression of v-slfn reverses the growth arrest resulting from m-slfn1 expression, and this is a result of a reversal of the inhibition of cyclin D1 expression. This effect can be seen following overexpression of various transcription factors that upregulate cyclin D1 expression. Recombinant VACV expressing enhanced levels of v-slfn replicated and spread at a comparable rate to control viruses in vitro, but was less virulent than controls in the intranasal model of infection in vivo. A group of viruses based on VACV WR were constructed, which lack the gene fragments (B2R and B3R) corresponding to CMLV176R. The undisrupted sequence for 176R was also re-inserted at this locus, resulting in a virus that expresses v-slfn from its natural promoter. In vitro characterisation showed no differences in replication or spread when compared to controls. Thus, v-slfn is an orthologue of mammalian slfn proteins, and may exert its effect by reversing their inhibition of cellular proliferation.

=520  3\$aThe process of pharmaceutical tabletting involves the application of stress onto the powdered drugingredients contained within a rigid die. This compaction process will cause the powder to densifyand form a tablet, which is then ejected from the die cavity. In reality, the tablet will incur someelastic strains during the compaction process and the tablet dimensional changes resulted due to theelastic relaxation of the tablet in the subsequent processing stages undermine the final tabletmechanical integrity. The ejection stage, where the tablet is extruded from the die, has not beenstudied extensively and is an important stage where any tabletting defects are immediately visible. It is then the purpose of this Thesis to experimentally elucidate the behaviour of the tablet elasticrelaxation and its influence on the tablet mechanical integrity during the ejection, the final stage ofthe compaction process. The Thesis starts with highlighting the existence of the tablet elastic relaxation during the ejectionstage that has been successfully studied on-line by the novel use of accurate laser sensors to recordthe tablet dimensional changes, with particular emphasis on the interrelationship of the tablet elasticrelaxation with the observed ejection force and the tabletting defects of the Paracetamol tablet. Theuse of a lubricated die has also been shown to reduce the tablet elastic relaxation and the tablettingdefects of the Paracetamol tablets. In terms of the time-dependent nature of the elastic relaxation,subtle time-dependent elastic relaxation behaviour has been observed and eludicated for the chosentime-dependent Starch material. A brief, but detailed and comprehensive material comparisonconsisting Aspirin, microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel) and Paracetamol is presented in terms of theelastic relaxation during the ejection stage. The observed tablet elastic relaxation is theninterrelated with the tablet strength, which is determined by an indirect tensile test (Brazilian) and adirect tensile test. Finally, the presence of a localized elastic relaxation occurring at the interface ofan Avicel bilayered tablet has been shown to undermine the strength of the bilayered tablet, wherethe extent of the interface weaknesses is clearly dependent upon the behaviour of the localizedelastic relaxation. In conclusion, the Thesis has successfully demonstrated and elucidated the tabletelastic relaxation behaviour during the ejection stage and the consequences on the final tabletmechanical integrity.

=520  3\$aThe long term aim of this work is to study the suitability of using laser cooled Ca+ ions in Penning traps as the basic components of a quantum computer. A great deal of progress in the field of quantum computing has been made in recent years with laser cooled ions stored in radio frequency ion traps. Building a useful quantum computer with trapped ions is however extremely challenging. Penning traps offer some possible benefits over radio frequency traps. They also create some additional difficulties. The potential advantages and disadvantages of Penning traps are discussed throughout the thesis. We show that we are able to overcome the problems associated with laser cooling in Penning traps, and have trapped single ions for extended periods of time. Pairs of Ca+ ions have been aligned along the axis of a Penning trap, and have been optically resolved. A novel Penning trap array based on PCB boards has been developed. A prototype was built and tested, along with the electronics required to shuttle ions between different sub-traps. Ions have been shuttled a distance of 10 mmin 2.5 μs. A return trip efficiency of up to 75% was seen. A quantum effect - J-state mixing caused by large magnetic fields - has been observed for the first time in single atomic ions. The magnetic field causes a forbidden [Delta]J = 2 transition to become weakly allowed. This effectis of general interest in atomic physics, and is also very relevant for quantumcomputation studies. A quantitative prediction of the magnitude of the J-mixing effect has been derived theoretically. This is compared to experimental data, and is found to be in excellent qualitative and good quantitative agreement.

=520  3\$aThe majority of power distribution networks were planned, designed and built asa passive but reliable link between the bulk power transmission point and the in-dividual customer. Enough latent capacity in cables and lines to accommodateanticipated demand growth was allowed and so the system was left unmonitored. Following the signicant development in business regulation, technology evolutionsand various government policies towards low carbon renewable generation, it hasbecome necessary to operate the distribution systems efficiently and in a controlledmanner. This obviously needs state estimation for network control functions. Stateestimation is the core function of any energy management system in transmissionnetworks. However little emphasis have been given to the distribution system stateestimation, mainly due to the absence of adequate network measurements and alsolack of rigorous methodology and tools that could be applied on restricted measure-ments. The scarcity of measured information offers formidable challenge to the stateestimator to provide reasonably meaningful estimates of the system states. Thisintroduces bottlenecks in carrying out a range of substation and feeder automa-tion tasks that rely on the quality of the state estimator and opens up many issueslike modelling of demand, identification of suitable estimator and placement of newmeasurements etc. This thesis attempts to address these issues. Thus, the objec-tives of this research are to model the demand as pseudo measurement, identify thestate estimation methodology to suite the distribution scenarios and find the effec-tive locations for placing measurements for improving the quality of the estimatedquantities. The thesis discusses in detail the criterion for identifying suitable solversfor the distribution system state estimation and stochastic optimisation methods tomodel the demand. It also discusses a probabilistic technique for identifying effective locations for measurement placement. The robustness of the state estimationalgorithm against changes in network topology has been addressed in a statisticalframework. All the concepts have been demonstrated on 12-bus radial and 95-busUKGDS network models.

=520  3\$aMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous, non-coding RNA species that regulate geneexpression at the post-transcriptional level. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs areimportant for cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, and are critical determinants oftissue metabolism. To investigate the role(s) of miRNAs in the insulin resistant heart, left ventricular biopsies were collected from patients with normal ventricular function with or without type 2 diabetes, and patients with left ventricular dysfunction (LVD). Using TaqMan based reverse transcriptase PCR, quantitative expression levels of 155 mature miRNAs in normal and diabetic hearts were determined. Five miRNAs were significantly upregulated in the diabetic human heart. Among these, miR-223 was upregulated in both diabetic heart and patients with LVD. Adenoviral-mediated over expression of miR-223 increased baseline glucose uptake in cardiac myocytes in vitro with an effect size similar to that observed for insulin stimulation. This increase was associated with increase in Glut4 protein expression but independent of PI3K/Akt signalling and AMPK activity. In contrast to findings in other cells, in cardiac myocytes miR-223 did not downregulate protein levels of Mef2c or Igf1r, and an unexpected increase in NfIaprotein was observed, where all three genes are miR-223 targets in immune cells. Systemic inhibition of miR-223 in vivo decreased blood glucose level 48 hours after administration and increased Glut4 protein level in the skeletal muscle, however Glut4levels were decreased in the heart. Cardiac-specific transgenic mice overexpressing miR-223 showed no detectable changes in Glut4 protein level and cardiac insulin signalling at baseline. Collectively, these data characterise the expression of miRNAs in the human heart, demonstrate that miRNAs regulate gene targets in a cell/tissue type specific manner, they can unexpectedly increase protein expression in cardiac myocytes, and miR-223 regulates cardiac glucose metabolism through a non-canonical pathway, which may have implications for future investigations and treatment of insulin resistance.

One very important physical characteristic ofa dust grain immersed in a plasma environment, which plays a central role in thestudy of its dynamical behaviour, is its charge. It determines the ion and electronfluxes on the dust and through that, one can calculate the forces exerted on the solidparticle and the energy fluxes onto it. In this work an overview of the basic chargingtheory used in dusty plasma, the Orbital Motion Limited (OML) approach, will bepresented, and its implications will be studied in the context of RF discharges andtokamak plasmas. In the case of RF discharges, modifications of the OML approachwill be explored for the accommodation of time varying phenomena. This will havetwo directions. The first, concerning the presence of time varying electric fields in auniform plasma background and the second, the presence of different forms of timedependent current carrying electron distributions. In the tokamak case, the workis focused on the modelling of the dynamical behaviour of dust particles in a tokamakplasma environment. An improved version of the existing Dust in TOKamakS(DTOKS) code has been developed. Results for the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak(MAST) and ITER are presented, as well as an assessment of the importance of thevarious aspects of the physical model from the plasma background, the dust graincharge, the forces on the particle and the dust heating model. Furthermore, the firstbasic comparison between DTOKS and the DUST Transport (DUSTT) code, theonly other similar code available at the moment, is being presented.

=520  3\$aThe absence of an effective humoral response contributes to the failure of controlling HIV-1 infection. Methods to elicit a potent neutralising antibody response is still underway and this thesis explores three aspects that can affect neutralisation. The pseudovirus-based assay is now recommended as the standard assay for assessing neutralising antibody response. However, recent studies have reported discrepancies between pseduovirus-based assay and conventional PBMCs or other cell-based assays. The first aim is to investigate possible causes behind this difference. The effect of virus producer cell type and virus platform (pseudovirus vs. replication-competent) was examined and both parameters can affect neutralisation. The second aim was to study the the neutralising antibody response in patients with primary HIV-1 infection. A panel of 6 patients were selected from the SPARTAC clinical trial. Pseudoviruses were constructed with the env gene derived from patient samples at week 0 (baseline) and week 52. The evolutionary history and the neutralisation sensitivity of these primary isolates against a panel of broadly neutralising antibodies and heterologous and autologous sera were studied. The week 52 isolates escaped from antisera neutralisation rapidly, most likely at the glycan level. In addition, viral load was found to correlate directly with intra-patient viral diversity and evolutionary divergence over time. Finally, the effect of Nef on HIV-1 neutralisation was investigated. Recent reports suggest that Nef modifies HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein. Hence, neutralising antibody response might also be modified in the absence of Nef. When subjected to neutralisation with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, the Nef-deleted (ΔNef) HIV-1 was more readily neutralised than the wild-type (WT) virus. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that neutralising antibodies can capture ΔNef virus more efficiently than WT virus. However, the enhanced neutralisation of ΔNef virus was neither due to CD4-down regulation nor difference in glycosylation.

=520  3\$aCardiac patches comprised of embryonic stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (ESC-CMs) attached to biodegradable polymeric substrates were developed for patients suffering from heart attacks. Cardiomyocytes were derived from mouse and human embryonic stem cell (ESC). Thermoplastic elastomeric (TPE) block co-polymers poly(ethyleneterephthalate)/dilionic acid (PET/DLA), a relatively slow degrading biomaterial, served as substrates to deliver cardiomyocytes and to further support the myocardium after an infarct. Additionally, titanium dioxide (TiO₂) nanoparticles (NPs) (mean size 23 nm),were incorporated in the PET/DLA polymer in a concentration of 0.2wt%. Results showed TiO2 NPs to effect polymer mechanical properties, increasing material stiffness and tensile strength. The surface roughness and hydrophilicity of the biomaterial also increased upon addition of TiO₂ NPs. It was found that 0.2wt% TiO₂ NP addition enhanced cellular adhesion, spread and proliferation. A fibroblastic cell line, used to test proliferation, proliferated on both biomaterials with and without pre-gelatin coating. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into culture media, used as a marker of cell death did not differ significantly between biomaterials and tissue culture plastic (TCP). The cytotoxicity of TiO₂ NPs on adult cardiomyocytes, hESC-CMs and fibroblasts was also investigated at various concentrations (0-150 ppm) chosen based on their relevance for the intended application of the biomaterial. At 10 ppm the particles had no significant acute effect on cardiac contractility of either adult rat heart cells or hESC-CM. However, functional activity was significantly reduced, in terms of beating rate, over longer culture periods (4h). Further improvements were carried out to enhance the properties of the patch. The investigation included: i) lactide addition to the polymer to increase polymer degradation rate and ii) topographical surface changes introduced by aphase separation micromoulding technique (PS-M). Newly developed biomaterial was faster degrading (as measured by biomaterial % weight loss) and simultaneously encouraged fibroblast proliferation. Finally the biomaterials have been investigated ex vivo and in vivo by collaborators at NHLI (Imperial College London). The results have confirmed that the developed biomaterials in conjunction with cardiomyocytes from ESCs are promising for applications in myocardial tissue engineering (MTE) strategies with no adverse effect on cardiac functionality detected.

=520  3\$aAllogeneic T cell stimulation requires not only antigen-specific signals but also costimulatory signals, most importantly between CD80/86 on the antigen presenting cell and CD28 or CTLA4 on the T cell. Engagement of the T cell receptor without costimulation can lead to anergy and the subsequent induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs). T cell activation is also controlled by dendritic cell (DC) expression of the tryptophan-catabolising, immunomodulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase(IDO). Depletion of this essential amino acid, and/or the production of tryptophanmetabolites (kynurenines) inhibits T cell proliferation. With the aim of generating tolerogenic DCs for the induction of donor-specific transplantation tolerance, lentiviral vectors were used in this study for gene transfer into murine DCs. Firstly, an intracellular approach that prevents costimulation was developed: a fusion protein- CTLA4-KDEL- consisting of the extracellular domain of CTLA4 and the KDEL peptide [an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal] was expressed in DCs and prevented surface CD80/86 expression due to ER retention. A second approach used in the study involved the lentiviral gene transfer of IDO into DCs. The induction of donor-specific tolerance (mediated by Tregs with direct and indirect pathway allospecificity) was demonstrated, both in vitro and in vivo, using CTLA4-KDEL-expressing DCs. Linked suppression was observed and mediated by donor-specific Tregs. Although IDO-expressing DCs did not induce and/or sustain allogeneic T cell proliferation, this anergy lacked donor specificity. It was demonstrated that IDO+CD80/86+ DCs fail to induce and/or expand FoxP3+CTLA4+ Treg populations. Furthermore, IDO+CD80/86- DCs failed to sustain pre-induced populations of FoxP3+CTLA4+ Tregs (associated with a high rate of cell death). The capacity of CTLA4-KDEL- and IDO-expressing DCs to induce tolerance to allografts was investigated using a murine corneal allograft model, and administration of CTLA4-KDEL-expressing DCs prevented allograft rejection. The study demonstrates the clinical potential of CTLA4-KDEL-expressing DCs to induce Treg-mediated,donor-specific transplantation tolerance.

=520  3\$aIn collaboration with David Baulcombe and Attila Molnar we have generated microRNA libraries for human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) before and after differentiation along the neuronal lineage and also from human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Both cell types are of medical importance and understanding how their proliferation and differentiation is regulated by microRNAs is also of scientific interest. The hMSC library was sequenced by 454 technology and the two subsequent hESC libraries by Solexa sequencing. Approximately a quarter of all currently known microRNAs were identified between the libraries, in addition to 3 novel microRNAs and 25 annotated piRNAs. For the hESC libraries, we verified the presence of embryonic specific microRNAs (miR-302 family) and neuronal specific microRNAs (miR-9/miR-9*), and demonstrated that expression of these miRNAs is regulated at the transcriptional level. Additionally, promoter assessments of miR-9 transcription revealed that multiple upstream regions may be important in neuronal specific expression. Almost half of all known human microRNAs are located within the introns of host genes. We used microarrays to analyse host gene expression and found that there was little correlation with microRNA expression, indicating that many microRNAs are not regulated at the transcriptional level by their host promoter. Furthermore, the expression of microRNAs from the same cluster, and also from the same hairpin precursor, did not always correlate when compared between the stem cell libraries. Taken together, this data indicates that microRNAs are regulated at a variety of levels both pre- and post-transcriptionally. Many microRNA isomers were also detected that differed in expression between human cell types, and upon differentiation of the hMSCs through the osteoblastic lineage. Interestingly, microRNAs and some of their isomers showed different affinities for Argonaute proteins in pulldown assays. We also profiled mRNAs that were immunoprecipitated with Argonaute in order to identify miRNA targets.

=520  3\$aTime resolved 3D measurements of turbulent flames are required to further understandingof combustion and support advanced simulation techniques (LES). Computed Tomographyof Chemiluminescence (CTC) allows a flame's 3D chemiluminescence profile to beobtained by inverting a series of integral measurements. CTC provides the instantaneous3D flame structure, and can also measure: excited species concentrations, equivalenceratio, heat release rate, and possibly strain rate. High resolutions require simultaneousmeasurements from many view points, and the cost of multiple sensors has traditionallylimited spatial resolutions. However, recent improvements in commodity cameras makesa high resolution CTC sensor possible and is investigated in this work. Using realistic LES Phantoms (known fields), the CT algorithm (ART) is shown toproduce low error reconstructions even from limited noisy datasets. Error from selfabsorptionis also tested using LES Phantoms and a modification to ART that successfullycorrects this error is presented. A proof-of-concept experiment using 48 non-simultaneousviews is performed and successfully resolves a Matrix Burner flame to 0.01% of the domainwidth (D). ART is also extended to 3D (without stacking) to allow 3D cameralocations and optical effects to be considered. An optical integral geometry (weighteddouble-cone) is presented that corrects for limited depth-of-field, and (even with poorlyestimated camera parameters) reconstructs the Matrix Burner as well as the standard geometry. CTC is implemented using five PicSight P32M cameras and mirrors to provide 10simultaneous views. Measurements of the Matrix Burner and a Turbulent Opposed Jetachieve exposure times as low as 62 μs, with even shorter exposures possible. With only10 views the spatial resolution of the reconstructions is low. However, a cosine Phantomstudy shows that 20-40 viewing angles are necessary to achieve high resolutions (0.01-0.04D). With 40 P32M cameras costing £40000, future CTC implementations can achievehigh spatial and temporal resolutions.

=520  3\$aTitanium alloys find extensive use in the biomedical field, including applications in theform of a porous structure as a scaffold material for bone repair. Scaffold materials havedemanding mechanical and biocompatibility requirements, which vary depending on theorthopaedic application. These requirements are determined by both the porousmacrostructure of the foams and the strut wall microstructure. Therefore techniques areneeded to characterise these structural features and relate them to the mechanical andphysical properties. In this thesis new methods were developed to both manufacturetitanium alloy foams and characterise them. Non- destructive X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) methods were employed tocharacterise the pore and interconnect size. The pore and interconnect size dominates theflow properties (permeability) of open-foam structures. Thus, μCT data was meshed andcomputational fluid dynamics analysis was performed to predict permeability. Directfinite element modelling, continuum micromechanics and analytical models of the foamwere employed to characterise the elasto-plastic deformation behaviour. Pore anisotropywas quantified and related to the yield stress anisotropy, allowing identification of initialpore collapse. These results were validated against experimental measurements. Finally, the conventional production method of porous titanium is achieved through acostly multi-step powder metallurgical (PM) route. A new, potentially low cost, methodwas developed to produce porous titanium with properties similar or better than theexisting titanium foam from a ceramic precursor via an electrochemical route. Two stepswere involved: (1) preparing the ceramic precursor foam via a gel-casting route; and (2)reducing the oxide electrochemically via the FFC (Fray, Farthing and Chen) Cambridgeprocess. The results of this preliminary study are very promising, with the foamsproduced via this method demonstrating mechanical and physical properties comparableto conventionally manufactured foams.

=520  3\$aVertical Displacement Events (VDEs) are a major concern for future tokamakoperation since their consequences?halo currents and the associated j ? B forceson the vacuum vessel?have the potential to be very damaging when scaled upto ITER-size devices. VDEs become more likely for elongated plasmas, which areinherently vertically unstable and most tokamaks, including ITER, will operatewith elongated plasmas to take advantage of the higher [Beta], and therefore higherefficiency. Plasma stability to vertical displacement and halo current mitigationare therefore critical areas of study for future tokamak devices. The extreme geometry of Spherical Tokamaks (STs) makes them interesting machineson which to investigate stability and halo current behaviour, and none moreso than the Mega Amp`ere Spherical Tokamak (MAST), which has a unique openvacuum vessel design. This thesis combines simple analytic exploration, theoreticalmodelling, and experimental work and analysis on the MAST tokamak. The vertical stability of the plasma is studied in MAST with a view to determiningwhether the non-linearity in the vertical feedback controller is increased inSTs compared to conventional tokamaks. It is thought that the higher curvatureof the vertical field index in STs will play a role, along with the deterioration inefficacy of the vertical feedback with progressing excursion from equilibrium. Theopen design of the MAST vessel brings an extra dimension to the problem, withthe passive stabilisation being provided by internal coil casings. Contrary to thedesign of many other tokamaks, where a toroidal shell with coils outside is used,the MAST vessel is cylindrical with poloidal field coils hanging on the inside. Theorigin of non-linearity in the plasma response is explored by way of a simple heuristicanalytic model of an up-down symmetric plasma. Simulations are made usingthe non-linear equilibrium evolution code DINA-CH to model plasma dischargessubject to a sinusoidal perturbation. Both MAST and a hypothetical conventionalaspect ratio tokamak are investigated. The responses of the plasma are subjectedto harmonic analysis to determine the non-linearity in the systems and enhancednon-linearity is found in MAST. Experiments undertaken specifically to explorethis effect in the MAST tokamak are also detailed. These non-linear effects inplasma control require consideration by controller designers. Having examined plasma stability in MAST, one of the primary consequencesof VDEs?halo currents?are explored in detail. Forced VDE experiments aredescribed and the data analysed to give a picture of where in the MAST vesselhalo currents flow. A new method is developed for use with the DINA code tocalculate the halo currents flowing in the different passive conductors, based onsumming over flux surfaces. Further investigation is made into the stability ofthe MAST plasma at high displacements from equilibrium, and it is found thatMAST has a region of extreme instability, where both the feedback and the passivestabilisation are insufficient to hold the plasma and thus the plasma accelerationis very rapid. The mechanisms for generating halo currents are considered in detail and ananalytic circuit-equation model is used to demonstrate the consistency of our understandingand to investigate the relative strength of the main drivers in MAST.

=520  3\$aBeing able to accurately predict the lifetime of polyolefins is very important in industry for water and gas distribution systems. Having reliable knowledge of the lifespan and maintenance requirements of such networks is crucial to be able to schedule maintenance and avoid emergency repairs which are very costly and disruptive especially when pipes are run under busy streets of towns, cities and other thoroughfares in highly populated areas. There is much research into improving the reliability and longevity of polyolefins. To do this, there needs to be an understanding of the failure mechanisms brought about by ageing. Newer resins are increasingly resistant to onset of brittle failure and as such current test methods are struggling to keep up with their assessment. Therefore, more discriminating laboratory experiments are required to measure the improved resistance of brittle fracture of these newer resins. When investigating Slow Crack Growth (SCG) in polyethylene (PE) it is important to understand how a crack is initiated and the mechanisms by which it propagates. Several of the main tensile, constant stress tests that are currently used to evaluate polymer life expectancies that have been proven by many researchers of SCG over the years are described, as well as several notching methods associated with the tensile tests. For the new experimental procedure the research partner required the following conditions: • To be a tension test with plane strain stress conditions; • For the sample to be in a bath at elevated temperature and with an accelerating agent (Arkopal N100); • Failure times to be faster than the current setup using the Full Notch Creep Test (FNCT) and the samples used must have certain dimensions; • The evaluative procedure to be able to simply rank PE grades by failure time and then if possible correlate the failure times to life expectancy. For development of the new experimental procedures the starting point was the standard FNCT which has a square ligament cross section. By modifying ligament cross section, applied stress, notch depth, notch angle and notch geometry a more discriminating experimental procedure was developed which reduced the time to failure by roughly half when compared to the FNCT. This failure time can then be correlated to an approximation of the pipes ESCR, i.e. its lifetime whist in use. Results clearly demonstrated the transition for ductile to brittle behaviour with ageing of the polymer resins. A valuable acceleration of the failure process has been achieved which allows an increased number of assessments to be made on new resins. Failure processes have been observed optically and by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to identify the micro-mechanisms of fracture.

=520  3\$aOver the years the NHS has made great strides towards engaging patients in their healthcare management. In more recent years, the way in which patients could help to improve patient safety by reducing/preventing rates of medical errors has been highlighted. However, despite growing recognition of the valuable role of the patient in improving patient safety, very little is known about patients' preferences for taking on an active role. This thesis aims to address the current gap in the evidence base with specific reference to a hospital inpatient cohort. Review work and a series of empirical investigations were undertaken which examined patients' willingness and ability to participate in a range of safety-related behaviours. In total, empirical data was collected from 580 medical and surgical inpatients, using quantitative and mixed-method approach methodologies. A number of conclusions can be drawn from the research. Patients were more willing to engage in long standing safety recommendations than those practices which are newer or unfamiliar to the patient. Patients were particularly reticent to engage in those behaviours that they perceive as challenging the clinical abilities of healthcare staff. Several strategies appeared to be effective for encouraging patients to participate in safety-related behaviours: namely, patient-focussed leaflets or videos, or by patients being given encouragement from the doctors or nurses involved in the patient's care. Overall the work in this thesis strongly suggests that while there is much to gain from involving patients in safety-related aspects of their healthcare management, patients need to be educated about how to be involved and where they can access safety-related information resources. In addition, doctors and nurses can have a pivotal role in encouraging patient involvement. Thus, it is paramount that both patients and healthcare professionals support patient participation in this area and healthcare professionals actively encourage the involvement of the patient.

=520  3\$aThe ever-increasing generation and submission of DNA sequences, and associated biological data, to publicly available databases demands software for the analysis of the biological meanings held within. The web provides a common platform for the provision of tools enabling the concurrent deposition, visualisation and analysis of data collected by many users from many different locations. Open programmatic web standards allow the development of applications addressing diverse biological questions and, more recently, are providing methods enabling functionality more traditionally associated with desktop software to be provided via the internet. In this work I detail the development and use of web applications addressing different, but not exclusive, areas of infectious disease microbiology. Firstly, an application utilised by a group of researchers (including myself) to undertake a comparative genetic analysis of the capsular biosynthetic locus from serotypes of the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae is detailed. Secondly, an application widely used by communities of researchers and public health laboratories for the assignment of microbial isolates to strains via the internet: mlst.net is described. Thirdly, I describe a generic electronic taxonomy application for assigning strains to bacterial species, exemplified using sequences from the viridans group streptococci, the taxonomy of which is notoriously difficult to define. Lastly, I describe the use of web mapping tools for molecular epidemiological databases, such as mlst.net, and further detail their application to the European distribution of genotypes of Staphylococcus aureus, to catalogue the global distribution of the emerging amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and to provide geocoding tools to encourage users to submit and explore their own data in the geographical context they were collected. Each application has been designed with generality in mind and through reference to user workflows and biological examples, I demonstrate the extensibility and general applicability of current web development methodologies to enable the provision of applications addressing a diversity of biological questions.

=520  3\$aThe Pd-catalyzed amination of aryl halides (Buchwald-Hartwig amination) hasbecome a versatile and widely used technology to synthesize and produce aromaticamines relevant in pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. The aim of the workpresented in this thesis is to achieve a better mechanistic understanding of thisreaction. The methodologies used were not traditional and focused on kineticstudies, carried out using in-situ tools, mainly reaction calorimetry. Reactions using different amines have been considered: the kinetic behaviour of astraight-chain primary amine (n-hexylamine) was found to be very different from thekinetics of benzophenone hydrazone. This difference was rationalised by consideringthe mechanism and by proposing a change in the rate-limiting step. Spectroscopicstudies, aimed at determining the catalyst resting state, supported our proposals. We subsequently started studies on the competitive system of two amines and onearyl halide. We found that, surprisingly, the less reactive amine, when in competition,reacted first. This intriguing behaviour was rationalised by considering the Curtin-Hammett principle and by recognizing that in this case selectivity was controlled byrelative stability of intermediates, not relative reactivity. This was termed?monopolizing? regime, in contrast to the ?major-minor? regime in which the minorbut more reactive intermediate produces the major product. Subsequent studies revealed that the benzophenone hydrazone product also binds to the Pd/BINAP catalyst, and, during the hexylamine reaction, inhibits the rate andinduces a change in the rate limiting step and catalyst resting state. Reactions using benzophenone imine were then studied. The competitive system ofbenzophenone imine and benzophenone hydrazone provided an example of asystem showing a change from the ?monopolizing regime? to the ?major-minor?regime. These concepts can be generalized and applied to explain selectivity in othercompetitive catalytic systems.

=520  3\$aEnteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), and Citrobacter rodentium are diarrhoeal pathogens grouped together on the basis of their ability to intimately adhere to host intestinal epithelia and efface brush border microvilli to form the broader category of attaching effacing (A/E) pathogens. While EPEC and EHEC are human pathogens of global health concern, C. rodentium is a natural murine pathogen which serves as an excellent animal model for in vivo studies. A/E pathogens encode a filamentous type 3 secretion system (T3SS) which is used to deliver virulence factors called effectors directly into the host cell. Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that the T3SS is integral to the A/E pathogen virulence strategy. Once translocated to the host cell, effector proteins modulate and disrupt a wide range of host cell signalling pathways and processes including the immune response, cytoskeletal dynamics, GTPase signalling pathways, phagocytosis and apoptosis. As a defence strategy, the host responds by activating an immune response and apoptosis. However, several studies have reported that epithelial cells infected with EPEC do not undergo apoptosis despite the presence of early markers of apoptosis. Recently the NleH effectors were identified in a secretomic and genomic analysis, however their function remains unknown. NleH effectors are present in all sequenced A/E pathogen strains and can be found in duplicate copies (nleH1 and nleH2). We verified that EPEC NleH1 and NleH2 are secreted and translocated in a T3SS dependent manner. In this study we demonstrate that NleH effectors have anti-apoptotic function. During infection of cultured cell lines, we found increased nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing, caspase-3 cleavage and cell death and detachment in an nleH1 and nleH2 double mutant in comparison to wild type EPEC. Furthermore, treatment with a global caspase inhibitor abolished cell loss due to cell death or detachment. Using ectopic expression, we showed that NleH1 alone is sufficient to inhibit caspase-3 cleavage in the presence of the general apoptosis inducers staurosporine and the ER stress apoptosis inducers tunicamycin and brefeldin A. Interestingly we found that NleH effectors are kinases, however their kinase activity is not involved in the inhibition of apoptosis. However, an intact C terminus is essential for NleH's anti-apoptotic activity. To determine the pathway by which NleH effectors inhibit apoptosis a HeLa human cDNA library was used to screen for potential binding partners using a Y2H assay. The ER anti-apoptotic protein Bax inhibitor 1 (BI-1) was identified as a putative binding partner and verified using a direct 2 hybrid assay. Knockdown of BI-1 resulted in loss of NleH's cytoprotective function. As BI-1 plays a role in calcium homeostasis, the effect of NleH effectors on cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels was assessed. We found that NleH effectors reduced cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels in a BI-1 dependent manner. Using the C. rodentium animal model we verified the ability of NleH to inhibit apoptosis in vivo by demonstrating that NleH inhibits caspase-3 activation and nuclear condensation at the site of bacterial attachment. Furthermore, we found a reduction in cell exfoliation in the presence of NleH. Additionally we showed that the NleH effectors play a role in competitiveness and also induce a mild but significant increase in NF-KB activation and TNF-α expression. Together our results demonstrate that NleH effectors are multi-functional proteins that inhibit apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo, and are kinases with an unknown function. Furthermore, NleH effectors induce a local NF-KB and TNF-α upregulation which could be linked to its anti-apoptotic activity. NleH effectors may provide a competitive advantage by preventing shedding of infected cells to prolong infection.

=520  3\$aThe Spherical Tokamak (ST) concept has become one of the main avenues in magneticnuclear fusion research since STs successfully demonstrated plasma operationat [Beta] = 2P[mu]0=B2~1. Next step ST machines aiming at achieving burning plasmaconditions in high [Beta] plasmas are being planned, such as the Spherical TokamakPower Plant (STPP) and the Component Testing Facility (CTF). Instabilities offast particle-driven Alfven eigenmodes are often observed in present-day STs. Suchinstabilities, driven by fusion-born alpha particles as well as by fast ions producedwith auxiliary heating schemes, in the next step STs may pose a major problem asthese instabilities may affect confinement and losses of the fast ions. A theory of compressional Alfven eigenmodes (CAE) with frequencies above thedeuterium cyclotron frequency,[omega] > [omega]cD, is developed for plasma parameters of aSTPP, and modes in the ion-ion hybrid frequency range, [omega]cT < [omega] < [omega]cD, are alsoinvestigated in order to assess the potential of diagnosing the deuterium-tritium(D-T) ratio. For the 1-D character of a STPP equilibrium with [Beta]~1 , a `hollowcylinder toroidal plasma model is employed for studying CAEs with arbitrary valuesof the parallel wave-vector k[||] = k[.]B/|B|. The existence of weakly-damped CAEs,free of mode conversion, is shown to be associated with the `well in the magneticfield profile, B = B (R), that can exist at the magnetic axis. A significant part of this thesis focusses on the experimentally observed effectsof resonant wave-particle interaction between Alfven waves and fast particles in theMega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) device at the Culham Laboratory, UK, andin the LArge Plasma Device (LAPD) in the University of California, Los-Angeles,USA. New robust experimental scenarios for exciting CAEs in the MAST spherical tokamak are developed, and interpretation of the observed CAEs in the frequencyrange [omega]cD/3 < [omega] < [omega]cD is given in the context of the 1-D ST model and the Dopplershifted cyclotron resonance. The e ciency of the Doppler resonance between coand counter directed fast ions and left and right hand polarised Alfven waves isfurther assessed experimentally on the LAPD device, with probe ions injected inthe presence of Alfv en waves launched by an external antenna. The developed theory of CAEs is then applied to a calculation of the linear kineticdrive of CAEs in the MAST experiments. A model representation of the fast iondistribution function, produced by neutral beam injection (NBI), is used by fittingto the TRANSP Monte-Carlo NBI modelling results. The main free energy sourcesassociated with temperature anisotropy and bump-on-tail are estimated analytically,and the CAE stability boundary is qualitatively assessed. In order to explain the experimentally observed difference between steady-stateand pulsating Alfvenic modes, the non-linear theory of fast particle driven modesnear marginal stability is extended to include dynamical friction (drag). For thebump-on-tail problem, the drag is shown to always give an explosive amplitudeevolution in contrast to diffusion in velocity space in the vicinity of the wave-particleresonance. This is then extended to the case of experimentally observed NBI-driventoroidal Alfven eigenmodes (TAEs) in the MAST machine. The experimentallyobserved differences between TAEs driven by fast ions produced with ion cyclotronresonance heating (ICRH) and NBI are then interpreted. The problem of dragdominated collisions for modes excited by fusion-born alpha particles in burningplasmas such as a STPP and ITER is underlined.

=520  3\$aThis thesis concerns the development of an exact or fully nonlinear numericalmodel capable of describing surface water waves, including the occurrence of wavebreaking, and their interaction with structures. The motivation for this workarose, first because of an inability to model limiting and overturning waves indirectionally-spread seas and, second because of an inability to describe some ofthe highly nonlinear free-surface effects which arise when steep waves interact withsurface-piercing columns. On both counts the available design tools were knownto fall well short of accurately describing these important flows. The work hasinvolved the development of a three-dimensional, fully nonlinear, multiple-fluxBoundary Element Method (BEM) and has compared the results of this model todetailed laboratory observations. Quantitative comparisons of the numerical results to both new and existingexperimental data, much of which has been gathered as part of the study, arepresented. In order to accurately simulate the physical phenomenon associatedwith wave-wave and wave-structure interactions, it is necessary to formulate, storeand solve very large systems of equations. Consequently, the three-dimensionalnumerical code is executed using a parallel implementation. This is not onlynecessary to maximise its time efficiency, but to also allow the feasible simulationof realistic problems involving significant directional spreads. The applications ofthe model include:(a) Solitary waves overturning on impermeable plane beach slopes.(b) Irregular (or unsteady) waves interacting with a vertical wall.(c) Waves interacting with submerged breakwaters and underwater caissons.(d) Overturning irregular waves, including descriptions of their associated waterparticle kinematics throughout the water column.(e) Waves interacting with surface-piercing columns, with details of the scatteredwaves arising. As a result of these studies, a new wave model has been fully validated, new numericaldescriptions have been obtained, and improved physical insights concerningpractically important problems have been realised.

=520  3\$aRecent developments in information and communication technology have meant that mobile commerce will have an increasingly important influence on the travel behaviour; in particular on how, when and where people choose to use their time to conduct activities. In the cases of activities involving the use of mobile services, such as m-shopping or m-banking, the conventional strong connection between the utility which one derives from an activity and its timing and duration are weakened or even broken such that existing utility-maximization models are not suitable in these contexts. This thesis presents a novel approach to characterising the utility of activities which can be applied in a broader set of circumstances, especially those such as m-services in which technology relaxes the patio-temporal constraints of activity participation. Building on concepts from both the microeconomic literature and the activity scheduling literature, the thesis proposes a unified utility framework based on an activity production approach, which is characterised by an activity production function. In this approach, an activity is regarded as the archetypal "small firm" theorised by Becker (1965). An individual transforms the inputs (purchased market goods, time, and technology) into the outputs (consumption commodities) through some activity production process. Both the production process and the outcome of consumption are potential sources of (dis)utility. We show how this framework generalises existing activity utility model and demonstrate how it can be extended to accommodate activities performed in both electronic and mobile contexts. A stated choice exercise was undertaken to obtain the data necessary to estimate utility models based on this new framework. In this exercise, a hypothetical shopping choice scenario was presented to respondents and a D-efficient design was adopted to investigate people's decision making with respect to shopping. Using the cleaned data generated by this data collection program, the basic model with the best overall level of fit was identified. Theoretical and empirical implications were discussed. Strong evidences of taste heterogeneity among respondents were also found.

=520  3\$aThis study can be divided into two sections. First, a detailed study of petrophysicalproperties and the impact of wettability is performed on cores from a producingheterogeneous carbonate reservoir from the Middle East. Second, a comparisonbetween different injection schemes (waterflooding, gas injection, WAG and CO2injection) for enhanced oil recovery is made for another giant carbonate reservoir inthe Middle East. Knowledge of the wettability of a reservoir rock and its influence on petrophysicalproperties is a key factor for determining oil recovery mechanisms and makingestimates of recovery efficiency. A full suite of experiments on well-characterisedsystems, including sandpacks, sandstones and carbonate cores, was performed tomeasure capillary pressure, relative permeability, NMR response and resistivityindex. Cores aged in crude oil, with different wettability were studied. As a preliminary step to investigate the effect of wettability on heterogeneouscarbonates from the Middle East, sandpack and sandstone samples were first testedbecause: 1) these samples are known to be quite homogeneous and of a wettabilitythat can be controlled; 2) To test our experimental methods; and 3) to serve as adataset for modelling studies. First, the static (porosity and permeability) and dynamic (initial water saturation andresidual oil saturation) properties of Leavenseat (LV60) and Ottawa (F-42) sandpackswere measured. The formation factor and NMR response for these sandpacks werealso determined. These experimental measurements have served as a benchmark forpore-modelling studies that have reproduced the experimental data. Fontainebleau sandstones have also been used as a benchmark in the industrybecause of its relatively simple pore structure. Mercury injection capillary pressure(MICP) measurements were performed on this sandstone. The MICP experimentalmeasurements showed very low pore volume values, indicating very tight(consolidated) samples. These samples had a diameter of less than 0.02 m whichmade the experiments quite difficult. Once we had confidence in the experimental methodology, five carbonate samplesfrom a typical Middle East reservoir were imaged and cleaned in order to renderthem more water wet. Conventional and special core analyses were performed on allthe samples. The pore throat distribution from capillary pressure was successfullycompared with the pore size distribution inferred from the NMR T2 relaxation curve. Formation resistivity factor and the formation resistivity index were also measured. Capillary pressure and relative permeability curves were measured using refined oiland synthetic formation brine. Then the samples were aged in crude oil from the same field at elevated temperature (120oC) and underwent the same experiments toevaluate the influence of wettability changes on these properties. The experimental data show that there is a significant difference in the relativepermeability and capillary pressure of the cleaned and aged samples; the results areexplained in terms of the pore-scale configurations of fluids. In contrast, electricalresistivity did not encounter significant changes for different wettability, suggestingthat electrical properties in these carbonates are mainly affected by the porosity thatremains water-wet, or is only neutrally-wet. This conclusion is supported by thesignificant displacement that is observed in the aged sample at capillary pressuresclose to zero. We show that wettability, imbibition capillary pressure and relative permeabilityhave major impact on the waterflood sweep efficiency and hence on the distributionof remaining oil saturation. An incorrect understanding of the distribution ofremaining oil saturation may lead to ineffective reservoir management and IOR/EORdecisions. The second part of this thesis is to assess the efficacy of CO2 injection into carbonateoil fields. The reservoir under study is a layered system. The reservoir consists of twomain units, i.e. a lower zone of generally low permeability layers and an upper zoneof high permeability layers inter-bedded with low permeability layers; the averagepermeability of the upper zone is some 10-100 times higher than that of the Lower zone. Under waterflooding, the injected water tends to flow through the upper zonealong the high permeability layers and no or very slow cross flow of water into thelower zone occurs, resulting in very poor sweep of the lower zone. There issignificant scope for improving oil recovery from such type of heterogeneous mixedwetcarbonate reservoirs. The apparent impediment to water invading the bottomstrata prompts suggests that a miscible fluid could be Injected into the lower zone. We conducted a series of core-flood experiments to compare the performance ofdifferent displacement process: waterflooding, hydrocarbon gas flooding and wateralternategas (WAG) and compared them with CO2 injection. We show that the localdisplacement efficiency for CO2 flooding is approximately 97% - much higher thanthat obtained from waterflooding or hydrocarbon gas injection, due to thedevelopment of miscibility between CO2 and the oil. We use the results to discussthe potential of CO2 injection for storage and enhanced oil recovery in the MiddleEast carbonate reservoir discussed above, and proposes further research to developa fuller understanding of the subsurface behavior of CO2.

=520  3\$aEpstein-Barr virus, EBV, is a human herpes virus that establishes a life long, persistent, latent infection in B lymphocytes. In vitro, EBV readily transforms and immortalizes primary B cells. EBV exists in two types, named EBV type 1 and type 2. These are defined on the basis of polymorphism in the EBNA2 locus. The EBNA2 gene encodes a viral transcription factor that controls viral and cell genes and is absolutely required for B cell transformation. EBV type 1 strains are much more efficient than EBV type 2 at transforming B cells and the enhanced transformation efficiency was previously mapped to the EBNA2 gene. A transfection assay was devised to compare the ability of type 1 and type 2 EBNA2 to sustain cell proliferation in EREB2.5 lymphoblastoid cells, which contain a ΔEBNA2-Epstein-Barr virus and express a conditional EBNA2. The reduced proliferation in cells expressing type 2 EBNA2 correlated with loss of expression of some cell genes that are known to be targets of type 1 EBNA2. Microarray analysis of EBNA2 target genes in stably transfected Burkitt lymphoma cells identified a small number of genes that are more strongly induced by type 1 than type 2 EBNA2 and one of these genes (CXCR7) was shown to be required for proliferation of lymphoblastoid cell lines. The Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 gene is directly induced by EBNA2 and is critically involved in B cell transformation. In Daudi Burkitt lymphoma cells, EBNA2type 1 induced LMP1 much more strongly than EBNA2 type 2, although both reached comparable levels after 48 hours. The results show that differential gene regulation by Epstein-Barr virus type 1 and type 2 EBNA2 is likely to be the basis for the much weaker B cell transformation activity of type 2 Epstein-Barr virus strains compared to type 1 strains.

=520  3\$aSingle view imaging data has been used in most previous research in computer vision andimage understanding and lots of techniques have been developed. Recently with the fastdevelopment and dropping cost of multiple cameras, it has become possible to have manymore views to achieve image processing tasks. This thesis will consider how to use theobtained multiple images in the application of target object recognition. In this context, we present two algorithms for object recognition based on scale-invariant feature points. The first is single view object recognition method (SOR), whichoperates on single images and uses a chirality constraint to reduce the recognition errorsthat arise when only a small number of feature points are matched. The procedure isextended in the second multi-view object recognition algorithm (MOR) which operates ona multi-view image sequence and, by tracking feature points using a dynamic programmingmethod in the plenoptic domain subject to the epipolar constraint, is able to fuse featurepoint matches from all the available images, resulting in more robust recognition. We evaluated these algorithms using a number of data sets of real images capturingboth indoor and outdoor scenes. We demonstrate that MOR is better than SOR particularly for noisy and low resolution images, and it is also able to recognize objects that arepartially occluded by combining it with some segmentation techniques.

=520  3\$aConsideration of stabilisation techniques is essential in the development of physical models ifthey are to faithfully represent processes over a wide range of scales. Careful application ofthese techniques can significantly increase flexibility of models, allowing the computationalmeshes used to discretise the underlying partial differential equations to become highly nonuniformand anisotropic, for example. This exibility enables a model to capture a widerrange of phenomena and thus reduce the number of parameterisations required, bringing aphysically more realistic solution. The next generation of fluid flow and radiation transport models employ unstructuredmeshes and anisotropic adaptive methods to gain a greater degree of flexibility. Howeverthese can introduce erroneous artefacts into the solution when, for example, a process becomesunresolvable due to an adaptive mesh change or advection into a coarser region of mesh inthe domain. The suppression of these effects, caused by spatial and temporal variations inmesh size, is one of the key roles stabilisation can play. This thesis introduces new explicit and implicit stabilisation methods that have beendeveloped for application in fluid and radiation transport modelling. With a focus ona consistent residual-free approach, two new frameworks for the development of implicitmethods are presented. The first generates a family of higher-order Petrov-Galerkin methods,and the example developed is compared to standard schemes such as streamline upwindPetrov-Galerkin and Galerkin least squares in accurate modelling of tracer transport. Thedissipation generated by this method forms the basis for a new explicit fourth-order subfilterscale eddy viscosity model for large eddy simulation. Dissipation focused more sharply onunresolved scales is shown to give improved results over standard turbulence models. Thesecond, the inner element method, is derived from subgrid scale modelling concepts and,like the variational multiscale method and bubble enrichment techniques, explicitly aims tocapture the important under-resolved fine scale information. It brings key advantages tothe solution of the Navier-Stokes equations including the use of usually unstable velocity-pressureelement pairs, a fully consistent mass matrix without the increase in degrees offreedom associated with discontinuous Galerkin methods and also avoids pressure filtering. All of which act to increase the flexibility and accuracy of a model. Supporting results are presented from an application of the methods to a wide rangeof problems, from simple one-dimensional examples to tracer and momentum transport insimulations such as the idealised Stommel gyre, the lid-driven cavity, lock-exchange, gravitycurrent and backward-facing step. Significant accuracy improvements are demonstratedin challenging radiation transport benchmarks, such as advection across void regions, the scattering Maynard problem and demanding source-absorption cases. Evolution of a freesurface is also investigated in the sloshing tank, transport of an equatorial Rossby soliton,wave propagation on an aquaplanet and tidal simulation of the Mediterranean Sea and globalocean. In combination with adaptive methods, stabilising techniques are key to the developmentof next generation models. In particular these ideas are critical in achieving the aim ofextending models, such as the Imperial College Ocean Model, to the global scale.

=520  3\$aFibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) are essential for controlling cell growth and proliferation, angiogenesis, wound healing and tumourigenesis. In mammals, there are twenty-three FGFs and five FGFRs, with each FGFR having different ligand binding specificities. FGFs are thought to act in a paracrine manner, in which they are secreted by one cell and activate FGFRs on another cell type, and such interaction helps to establish the fundamental crosstalk between epithelium and mesenchyme during development, homeostasis and tumourigenesis. This thesis aims to investigate the requirement of FGFR2-isoform IIIb(Fgfr2b) and one of its ligands, Fgf10, in gastrointestinal (GI) development, homeostasis and injury, using loss-of-function animal models. Fgfr2b-/- and Fgf10-/- exhibit similar multi-organ defects, including intestinal atresia. While caecal and colonic atresia have been previously described, the mechanism of duodenal atresia and the role of Fgf signalling in duodenal development have not been fully established. We demonstrate that absence of Fgfr2b or Fgf10 leads to decreased tissue proliferation and increased apoptosis in the duodenum, contributing to duodenal atresia. These mutants also develop gastric heterotopia in the rostral duodenum due to loss of gastric-intestinal boundary specification. In addition, we demonstrate reduced expression of Wnt targets Tcf1 and Tcf4 in the small intestine, with corresponding down regulation of Lgr5, an intestinal stem cell marker, and Cdx1, a homeobox gene involved in anterior-posterior patterning. We show by in vitro that Fgf10-Fgfr2b signalling is able to regulate Tcf4 expression via the Grb2/Sos/Ras/MAPK pathway. In order to study the requirement of Fgfr2b in intestinal homeostasis and injury, we crossed a transgenic line bearing a progesterone antagonist (RU486)-dependent Cre recombinase (A33-CrePR) expressed under the control of the intestinal-specific A33 antigen promoter, with an existing conditional Fgfr2b line. Following RU486 administration with/without administration of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) thereafter to induce ulcerative colitis (UC), the A33-CrePR+/Fgfr2bflox/flox targeted Fgfr2b ablation with high efficiency across the small and large intestine. We demonstrate that significant down regulation of Fgfr2b does not affect intestinal homeostasis, but significantly increases the susceptibility of colonic epithelium to UC and delays wound healing, contributed by reduced epithelial proliferation. In order to study the requirement of Fgfr2b in gastric homeostasis, we characterised two stomach-specific minimal promoters for trefoil factor 1 (Tff1) and H+K+-ATPase (Atp4b) to generate two inducible Cre recombinase (CreERT2) lines. Gastric surface mucous cells and acid producing parietal cells express Tff1 and Atp4b respectively, as well as Fgfr2b. We demonstrate by in vitro that Atp4b nucleotide -1,035bp to +24bp and Tff1 nucleotide -641 bp to +28 bp are optimal for driving Cre expression in the mouse stomach. Thus, our novel data provides evidence that Fgfr2b and Fgf10 are required for normal duodenal morphogenesis and differentiation, and Fgfr2b confers protection against DSS-induced colonic injury and promotes wound repair.

=520  3\$aIn longitudinal studies, data are collected on a group of individuals over a period of time, and inevitablythis data will contain missing values. Assuming that this missingness follows convenient `random-like patterns may not be realistic, so there is much interest in methods for analysing incompletelongitudinal data which allow the incorporation of more realistic assumptions about the missing datamechanism. We explore the use of Bayesian full probability modelling in this context, which involvesthe specification of a joint model including a model for the question of interest and a model for themissing data mechanism. Using simulated data with missing outcomes generated by an informative missingness mechanism,we start by investigating the circumstances and the extent to which Bayesian methods can improveparameter estimates and model fit compared to complete-case analysis. This includes examiningthe impact of misspecifying different parts of the model. With real datasets, when the form of themissingness is unknown, a diagnostic that indicates the amount of information in the missing datagiven our model assumptions would be useful. pD is a measure of the dimensionality of a Bayesianmodel, and we explore its use and limitations for this purpose. Bayesian full probability modelling is then used in more complex settings, using real examples oflongitudinal data taken from the British birth cohort studies and a clinical trial, some of which havemissing covariates. We look at ways of incorporating information from additional sources into ourmodels to help parameter estimation, including data from other studies and knowledge elicited froman expert. Additionally, we assess the sensitivity of the conclusions regarding the question of interestto varying the assumptions in different parts of the joint model, explore ways of presenting this information, and outline a strategy for Bayesian modelling of non-ignorable missing data.

=520  3\$aRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory condition affecting 1-3% of the world population. Half of all patients with RA have tendon involvement. This often leads to multiple tendon ruptures. Tendon rupture is a strong indicator of poor, long-term, hand function. When tendons rupture, painful reconstructive surgery is currently the only way of restoring useful hand function. Patients with RA also develop characteristic deformities which often interfere with hand function. These include swan-neck, boutonniere and ulnar drift deformities. In particular, the development of ulnar drift in RA hands has always been very difficult to explain and is equally difficult to correct surgically. Local hypoxia and angiogenesis are recognised as key events which may initiate and perpetuate joint destruction in RA. More recently, they have also been shown to be important in tendon rupture. Previous studies carried out by our group used a microelectrode technique to demonstrate that invasive tenosynovium in RA patients is markedly hypoxic compared to tenosynovium in patients without RA. The results of these studies led us to conclude that hypoxia plays a key role in initiating and perpetuating tendon destruction in the same way that hypoxia affects RA joints. Therefore, my research set out to investigate the role of tissue hypoxia in tendon rupture in more detail. To further investigate the effects of hypoxia in RA, synovial tissue was harvested and cultured under either hypoxic (1% O₂) or normoxic (21% O₂) conditions. Under hypoxic conditions, I observed a significant upregulation of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) responsible for collagen breakdown. This upregulation was inhibited in the presence of a universal blocker for MMP. The expression of angiogenic stimuli such as vascular endothelial growth factor was also increased and crucially, my data showed that hypoxia increases the angiogenic drive of RA cells, as demonstrated by enhanced blood vessel formation in an in-vitro angiogenesis functional assay. In this way, I was able to show that hypoxia creates a stimulus for RA tenosynovium which is pro-angiogenic and pro-invasive facilitating the tendon ruptures observed in RA. This has not previously been demonstrated. Intrinsic muscle dysfunction has been suggested as one of the mechanisms for the development of ulnar drift in RA hands. To investigate the possible link between hypoxia and ulnar drift, I speculated that the weakness and dysfunction of the intrinsic muscles observed in RA hands may also be due to hypoxia. Direct measurement of tissue oxygen in the intrinsic muscles of the RA hand has never been performed. Using our microelectrode technique, I found that the intrinsic muscles of RA patients undergoing elective surgery (n=30) are significantly more hypoxic than the intrinsic muscles of patients without RA (n=30). Within the RA group, I also observed a spatial trend for increasing hypoxia in the intrinsic muscles going from radial to ulnar. There was a further trend for increasing hypoxia moving from proximal to distal in the upper limb. My data confirmed that the intrinsic muscles are the most hypoxic. Therefore, it seems possible that hypoxia may at the very least contribute to the intrinsic muscle contracture and atrophy which are commonly observed in the RA hand. In so doing, intrinsic muscle hypoxia may contribute to the development of ulnar drift and the other deformities in the hand of RA patients. These findings have also never been demonstrated before. Many of the drugs currently used to treat RA (including anti-TNF drugs) fail to prevent inflammation of the tenosynovium in the hand in a significant proportion of patients. We are also unaware of any treatments to block, reverse or ameliorate the effects of chronic muscle hypoxia. These findings may explain why many of the disabling effects of RA often continue despite otherwise adequate control of pain and other symptoms, especially in the hand. This study represents a further step forward on the path to understanding the debilitating effects of RA in the hand and may lead to the development of new treatments to prevent them.

=520  3\$aBackground and aims: Early detection of oesophageal cancer is the most effective strategy to improve its outcome. The thesis explores the metabolic characteristics of oesophageal tumours as compared to normal tissue from same patients as well as that from healthy individuals. The aim is to characterise the basic metabolic profile of oesophageal cancer, detect possible evidence of field cancerization and to characterise effect of chemotherapy on oesophageal cancer tissue. The clinical benefit is to develop a non-invasive early test to be translated to the bed side/laboratory practice for screening, diagnosis and prediction of response to chemotherapy for patients with oesophageal tumours. Methods: Using ¹H Magic Angle Spinning-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy of intact tissue, we generated metabolic profiles of tumour tissue, proximal histologically normal mucosa from cancer patients (PHINOM) and mucosa from a control group. Using multivariate regression and receiver-operator characteristic analysis we were able to identify a panel of metabolites discriminating malignant and histologically-normal tissues from cancer patients from that of controls. Results: While 26% and 12% of the spectral profile regions were uniquely discriminating tumour or control tissue respectively, 5% of the profile exhibited a significant progressive change in signal intensity from controls to PHINOM to tumour. Regions identified were assigned to phosphocholine, glutamate, myo-inositol, adenosine-containing compounds, uridine containing compounds and inosine. In particular, the phosphocholine to glutamate metabolite ratio in histologically-normal tissue signified the presence of oesophageal cancer (n=123, AUC 0.84, p<0.001). Metabolites that were found to be significantly altered in correlation to response to chemotherapy are lysine, glutathione, creatine, taurine, uracil and tyrosine. Conclusion: The results of the study enable better understanding of the metabolic perturbations in oesophageal cancer. The findings support the hypothesis that field effects are present in oesophageal cancer, even in the absence of Barrett's oesophagus. This indicates that metabolic profiling of tissue can potentially play a role in the surveillance of cancer especially in high risk groups. It also shows the potential of using this methodology to study the prediction of response to chemotherapy. This helps aiding the clinical decision-making process and the implementation of personalized treatment protocols for different patients according to their disease extent and potential for response to chemotherapeutics.

=520  3\$aFirst, we consider two classes of coupled systems consisting of an infinite-dimensionalpart [sigma]d and a finite-dimensional part [sigma]f connected in feedback. In the first class of coupledsystems, we assume that the feedthrough matrix of [sigma]f is 0 and that [sigma]d is such thatit becomes well-posed and strictly proper when connected in cascade with an integrator. Under several assumptions, we derive well-posedness, regularity and exact (or approximate)controllability results for such systems on a subspace of the natural product statespace. In the second class of coupled systems, [sigma]f has an invertible first component in itsfeedthrough matrix while [sigma]d is well-posed and strictly proper. Under similar assumptions,we obtain well-posedness, regularity and exact (or approximate) controllability results aswell as exact (or approximate) observability results for this class of coupled systems onthe natural state space. Second, we investigate the exact controllability of the SCOLE (NASA Spacecraft ControlLaboratory Experiment) model. Using our theory for the first class of coupled systems,we show that the uniform SCOLE model is well-posed, regular and exactly controllablein arbitrarily short time when using a certain smoother state space. Third, we investigate the suppression of the vibrations of a wind turbine tower usingcolocated feedback to achieve strong stability. We decompose the system into anon-uniform SCOLE model describing the vibrations in the plane of the turbine axis,and another model consisting of a non-uniform SCOLE system coupled with a two-mass drive-train model (with gearbox), in the plane of the turbine blades. We show the strongstabilizability of the first tower model by colocated static output feedback. We also provethe generic exact controllability of the second tower model on a smoother state spaceusing our theory for the second class of coupled systems, and show its generic strongstabilizability on the energy state space by colocated feedback.

=520  3\$aLaser Surface Authentication (LSA) has emerged in recent years as a potentially disruptive tracking and authentication technology. A strong need for such a solution in a variety of industries drove the implementation of the technology faster than the scientific understanding could keep up. The drive to miniaturise and simplify, the need to be robust against real-world problems like damage and misuse, and not least, intellectual curiosity, make it clear that a firmer scientific footing is important as the technology matures. Existing scattering and biometric work are reviewed, and LSA is introduced as a technology. The results of field-work highlight the restrictions which are encountered when the technology is applied. Analysis of the datasets collected in the trial provide, first, an indication of the performance of LSA under real-world conditions and, second, insight into the potential shortcomings of the technique. Using the particulars of the current sensor?s geometry, the LSA signal is characterised. Measurements are made of the decorrelation of the signature with linear and rotational offsets, and it is concluded that while surface microstructure has a strong impact on the rate of decorrelation, this dependency is not driven by the surface?s feature size. A new series of experiments examine that same decorrelation for interference effects with different illumination conditions, and conclude that laser speckle is not an adequate explanation for the phenomenon. The results of this experimental work inform a mathematical description of LSA based on a combination of existing bi-static scattering models used in physics and ray-tracing, which is implemented numerically. The results of the model are found to be a good fit to experimental work, and new predictions are made about LSA.

=520  3\$aDetection and sizing of corrosion in pipelines and pressure vessels over large, partiallyaccessible areas is of growing interest in the petrochemical and nuclear industries. Traditionally, conventional ultrasonic thickness gauging and eddy current techniqueshave been used to precisely measure the thickness in structures. These techniquesonly allow the measurement of the local thickness under the probe. Consequentlyobtaining the remnant thickness of a specimen over a large area requires the probe tobe scanned, which is a long and tedious process. Moreover, with these techniques,the scanning may become impossible when the area of inspection is inaccessible. There is therefore a need for a rapid, accurate, long range inspection technique tomeasure the remaining thickness in corrosion patches. Low frequency guided waves are now routinely used to screen large area of pipes andother structures for cracks and corrosion. Their detection and location capability isvery good, but the standard screening technique only gives a rough estimate of theremaining wall thickness. Guided waves have multiple properties which can be usedfor thickness mapping over large partially accessible areas e.g. dispersion and cutofffrequency thickness product of the high order modes. The present work aims to demonstrate the potential of guided waves for thicknessmapping over large partially accessible areas. It starts with a general introductionon ultrasonic guided waves and a literature review of the different techniques for theevaluation of thickness with guided waves. The severity of the errors introduced intime-of-flight tomography for thickness reconstruction by breaking the assumptionof the ray theory are investigated. As these errors are significant, the possibility ofusing the cutoff property of the high order modes is investigated in a frequency rangewhere the ray theory is valid. It is found that the attenuation due to the scatteringof the waves in corrosion is too large for this technique to work. Finally the use oflow frequency guided wave for diffraction tomography is examined. Finite elementsimulations of a 64 element circular array on a plate show that when the scatteringmechanism of the object to be reconstructed satisfies the Born approximation the reconstruction of the thickness is accurate. However the practical implementation ismore challenging when the incident field is not known. Experimental results demonstratethat ultimately the scattering from the array of transducer is a major sourceof error in the tomographic reconstruction, but when there is no scattering fromthe array of transducers the reconstructions are very similar to the finite elementsimulations.

=520  3\$aThe Aegean archipelago, which has a mostly continental origin, provides a 'natural laboratory' to explore the effects of dispersal limitation on population and community structure. This thesis investigated the phylogeographic, genetic diversity and species richness patterns of the darkling beetles (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) of the central Aegean islands. Sampling was conducted on 30 islands and the corresponding coasts of Greece and Turkey and several individuals per taxon and locality were sequenced for mitochondrial and nuclear markers. The generated sequence data were used to: reconstruct phylogenies, calculate population genetic parameters, apply DNA-based species delineation methods, estimate substitution rates and assess macroecological patterns. The results show that many of the existing taxonomic names do not reflect the genetic diversification processes in the archipelago. The majority of the morphological species are split into several geographically confined clades, recognised as 'independently coalescing entities'. Habitat preference and wing development were identified as two major factors affecting phylogeographic structure, genetic diversity and macroecological patterns. Differences in dispersal propensity were observed between psammophilic taxa inhabiting ephemeral coastal sandy habitats and geophilic taxa associated with presumably stable compact-soil habitats. The widespread geophilic lineages were found to be deeply subdivided along the biogeographic barrier of the 'mid-Aegean trench', and the age of this geological event was used as a calibration point to estimate substitution rates and reassess the standard insect mitochondrial molecular clock. A positive species-genetic diversity correlation was recorded, driven primarily by island sizes and geographic distances, while certain macroecological regularities such as the species-area curve and the distance-decay of similarity relationship could be described at both species and haplotype level. This study demonstrated how palaeogeography, contemporary geography and habitat persistence interact with stochastic processes at population and community level to shape the observed diversity patterns of the Aegean tenebrionid fauna.

=520  3\$aThe work described here concerns the possibility that textured surfaces may reduce coefficients of friction and increase load support within hydrodynamic bearings. This topic is of particular interest in the context of the potential of texturing to reduce friction in internal combustion engines using techniques adapted to suit high volume production, such as Laser Honing. Despite the existence of a number of theoretical explanations (which include shear rate reduction, inlet suction, effect of the presence of cavitation and the mitigation of starvation) and numerous experimental reports as to the effect of texture on friction, there has been no simultaneous study of friction, cavitation and oil film thickness in textured hydrodynamic bearings. This is because such studies are difficult. One must address certain barriers which include the large range of oil film thicknesses encountered and the need for accurately known feature dimensions on the surfaces in question. A new test rig has been designed and constructed that enables the simultaneous measurement of friction, load and oil film thickness. Novel features include a rotating glass disc on a silicon pad, a high-sensitivity fluorescence imaging microscope system to determine the oil film thickness and a non-contact displacement sensor for friction measurement. The process of photolithography was used to accurately produce predetermined textures on silicon surfaces. Tests were conducted on convergent plain and textured silicon pads whilst concurrently monitoring friction, load, cavitation (if present) and oil film thicknesses. The results were compared to theoretical predictions based upon the solution of Reynolds equation, with cavitation, in two dimensions. Results show broad agreement with the theoretical predictions and suggest that textured surfaces may be either beneficial or detrimental according to both their geometry and the operating conditions.

=520  3\$aZnO nanostructures have great promise in a wide range of applications such as sensors, optoelectronics, piezoelectronics, healthcare. Preparation of oxide films by electrodeposition from aqueous solution presents several advantages over other techniques such as controlling the rate and morphology through several well-defined parameters (electrode potential, current, temperature, pH, etc.), the fact that electrolytic processing is a well-established technology and readily scalable for production, and the non-equilibrium nature of the electrochemical interface often gives rise to morphologies and compositions not attainable through other, usually high-temperature, routes. Despite a large amount of research in this area the detailed mechanism of nucleation and growth is still controversial. Only a good understanding of it will allow the expected industrial applications to be achieved. One of the main difficulties to overcome is that tiny amounts of material are involved and the required in-situ measurements are thus very delicate. The ability of synchrotron radiation to probe material structure during deposition makes it the ideal tool for the study of nucleation and growth of these materials as a function of the processing parameters. Here we will present two synchrotron-based approaches involving both X-ray absorption and scattering. The first method, together with ex-situ characterisation, provides detailed information about how the kinetics of the growth and/or dissolution is influenced by the electrochemical parameters. The effect of time, potential, zinc ions concentration, oxygen precursor, temperature and electrolyte composition have been studied. Following this understanding of the influence of the parameters, films of desired structure can be synthesised and new structures have been made. Beside the electrochemical parameters, the growth of the film is influenced by the interaction with substrate in the early stage of nucleation. The second synchrotron technique allows the direct observation of the development of the crystal orientation ofthe films during the deposition. It gives promising results to study how the substrate influences the growth and thus the properties of the films.

We show how to construct a multi-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain such thatit converges in distribution to a multi-dimensional diffusion process. The method is flexibleenough to be applied to a model where the underlying process contains local volatility, stochasticvolatility and jumps. Furthermore, we introduce a method to approximate the dynamics of therealized variance of a Markov chain and an algorithm to reduce the complexity of computingthe joint probability distribution between the realized variance and the underlying.

=520  3\$aThe glass polyalkenoate cements (GPCs) are formed by the acid-base reactionbetween fluoro-aluminosilicate glasses and polycarboxylic acid in the presence ofwater. Three series of glasses were produced by modifiying glass LG26 [32.1SiO2.21.4Al2O3. 10.7P2O5. 21.4CaO. 14.3CaF2] (mole %). In the first series, calcium wassubstituted by magnesium, and in the second series, calcium in the first series wassubstituted by strontium. The last series were zinc substitution for calcium in LG26.These glasses were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD), magic angle spinningnuclear magnetic resonance (MAS-NMR) spectroscopy and differential scanningcalorimetry (DSC). The gradual substitution of calcium by magnesium resulted in theformation of F-Mg(n) species and a disappearance of Al-F species on the 19F MAS-NMR.The 31P and 27Al MAS-NMR showed that all glasses contained Q1pyrophosphate Al-O-PO33- species. In addition, the fully magnesium substituted glassshowed the possible formation of magnesium pyrophosphate, Mg2P2O7. The fully zincsubstituted glass, however, showed only Al-O-PO33- species charge balanced by Zn2+.An increase in Al(V) species was observed on the 27Al MAS-NMR with the fullymagnesium and zinc substituted glasses. The presence of magnesium also increasedthe number of bridging oxygen on SiO4 tetrahedra, but the presence of zinc affectedthe Q structure of the aluminosilicate network less. GPCs with these glasses wereformed with poly (acrylic acid) (PAA) and L-(+)-tartaric acid. The setting reaction ofselected cements was studied by 19F, 31P and 27Al MAS-NMR spectroscopy. F-Ca(n)species were clearly shown to be consumed for cement formulation, and F-Mg(n)species were still present in the 19F MAS-NMR spectra of the magnesium containingcements. The Al-O-PO33- species were present in the cement. The conversion toAl(VI) from Al(IV) and Al(V) was observed by deconvoluting the 27Al MAS-NMRspectra. The experimental ratio of Al(VI):Al(IV)+Al(V) was higher than thetheoretical ratio which may have resulted from the possibility of L-(+)-tartaric acidbeing involved in the Al conversion during the setting reaction. The working andsetting times increased with magnesium substitution, but did not change with zincsubstitution for calcium. The compressive strengths decreased with magnesiumsubstitution, possibly resulting from the preferential crosslinking between Mg2+ andCOO-. The highest release of fluoride was observed from the fully magnesiumsubstituted cements. Another series of glasses [34.0SiO2. 22.6Al2O3. 5.7P2O5. (22.6-x)SrO. xZnO.15.1SrF2] (mole %) was produced for formulating GPCs with poly (?-glutamic acid),PgGA. All the glasses have Al-O-PO33- species with no change in the phosphorusenvironment with zinc substitution for strontium. Al(IV) was found to be the majoraluminium species with a small presence of Al(V) and Al(VI). The Q structures of allthe glasses were found to be a mixture of Q4(4Al) and Q3(3Al). Similarly, DSCshowed a negligible change with zinc substitution for strontium. For cementformulations with PgGA, a co-polymer of PAA and poly (but-3-ene 1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid) was used due to the lower reactivity of PgGA than PAA, andcements with different proportions of PgGA and the co-polymer were formed. Theworking and setting times increased with PgGA content and zinc substitution. On thecontrary, the compressive strengths decreased with PgGA content. The highest zinccontaining cements in the series showed the highest compressive strength. A longtermfluoride release measurement showed the highest release from the highest PgGAcontaining cements, possibly resulting from the cements being less crosslinked. Therewas a slight increase in the adhesion to dentine.

=520  3\$aSince the invention of the laser and its first application, there has been an almost continuousstream of new applications - many of which require specific laser sources. Theseapplications often require a laser source with a specific power, pulse duration, energyand wavelength. In some cases these demands are easily met, whilst in others they haveproven rather more difficult to achieve. Traditionally, wavelength versatility has beenlimited to the regions for which rare earth or gas gain media are available. These lasersthemselves can be used to generate other wavelengths through the nonlinear processes ofsecond and third harmonic generation, as well as sum frequency generation. Despite allof this, there still exists a significant section of the visible and infrared spectrum for whichno convenient sources exist. This thesis is concerned with the development of sources inthese regions along with broadband sources covering significant portions of the spectrumby themselves. These new wavelengths are generated in a variety of speciality fibres using eithernonlinear processes or new gain media doped into standard silica fibres. Three typesof speciality fibre are used: low concentration bismuth doped fibre which provides gainin the 1.0-1.4 ?m region; photonic crystal fibres; and very high (75%) concentrationgermanium fibres to generate a laser source at 2.1 ?m based upon stimulated Ramanscattering. Photonic crystal fibres provide high nonlinearities and controllable dispersionwhich enables the generation of broadband supercontinuum sources based upon theinteraction of many nonlinear effects. Each source will be described in depth, withparticular attention given to the underlying physics that gives rise to the source. Previousand current limitations will be examined and an outlook of the future development ofsuch sources will be discussed.

=520  3\$aInsecticide resistance is an important aspect of pest control on both crop pests and vectors of animal diseases. Resistance can be caused by a number of mechanisms, one of which is enhanced detoxification of the insecticide by metabolic enzymes. Synergists may be used in insecticide formulations to inhibit metabolic defences in the insect, allowing the insecticide to reach its target site and kill the insect, thus enhancing the effect of the insecticide. This PhD project investigated the use of the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) in combination with natural pyrethrins (tank mix) and as a pre-treatment prior to application of pyrethrins, as methods of enhancing the efficacy of the insecticide. The insects studied were Myzus persicae, Bemisia tabaci and Musca domestica. Results showed that the combination treatment (tank mix) was at least as good as, and sometimes better than, the pre-treatment. This is unlike the situation for synthetic pyrethroids where pre-treatments have been shown to be more effective than tank mixes. It is proposed that for natural pyrethrins, PBO aids the penetration of the pyrethrins into the insect, and this enhancement effect is greater than full inhibition of the metabolic enzymes. In some cases, the tank mix enabled less insecticide to be used to achieve 50% mortality in resistant insects, compared to a susceptible population treated with pyrethrins alone. A novel laboratory assay was developed to enable the screening of botanical extracts for their ability to inhibit esterase enzymes. This was used to test a range of compounds and those showing esterase inhibition were also screened for their ability to inhibit cytochrome P450 activity. The competency of some of these compounds as synergists was also tested in vivo with some showing potential activity both in vitro and in vivo.

Existing models incorporate some combination of three correlation terms:(i) the correlation between the multiple variables within each site, (ii) the spatialautocorrelation for each variable across the lattice, and (iii) the correlation betweeneach variable at one site and a different variable at a neighbouring site. These maybe thought of as correlation, spatial autocorrelation and spatial cross-correlationparameters respectively. This thesis develops a exible multivariate conditional autoregression model wherethe spatial cross-correlation is asymmetric. A comparison of the performance of theFMCAR with existing MCARs is performed through a simulation exercise. TheFMCAR compares well with the other models, in terms of model fit and shrinkage,when applied to a range of simulated data. However, the FMCAR out performs allof the existing MCAR models when applied to data with asymmetric spatial crosscorrelations. To demonstrate the model, the FMCAR model is applied to road safetyperformance indicators. Namely, casualty counts by mode and severity for vulnerableroad users in London, taken from the STATS19 dataset for 2006. However,by exploiting correlation between multiple performance indicators within localauthorities and spatial auto and cross-correlation for the variables across localauthorities, the FMCAR results in considerable shrinkage of the estimates oflocal authority performance. Whilst this does not enable local authorities to bedifferentiated based upon their road safety performance it produces a considerablereduction in the uncertainty surrounding their rankings. This is consistent withprevious attempts to improve performance rankings. Further, although the findingsof this thesis indicate that there is only mild evidence of asymmetry in the spatialcross-correlations for road casualty counts, the thesis provides a demonstration of theapplicability of this model to real world social and economic problems.

=520  3\$aInterpolation of discrete FIelds arises frequently in computational physics. This thesis focuses on the novel implementation and analysis of Galerkinprojection, an interpolation technique with three principal advantages overits competitors: it is optimally accurate in the L2 norm, it is conservative,and it is well-defined in the case of spaces of discontinuous functions. While these desirable properties have been known for some time, the implementationof Galerkin projection is challenging; this thesis reports the firstsuccessful general implementation. A thorough review of the history, development and current frontiers ofadaptive remeshing is given. Adaptive remeshing is the primary motivationfor the development of Galerkin projection, as its use necessitates the interpolationof discrete fields. The Galerkin projection is discussed and thegeometric concept necessary for its implementation, the supermesh, is introduced. The efficient local construction of the supermesh of two meshesby the intersection of the elements of the input meshes is then described. Next, the element-element association problem of identifying which elementsfrom the input meshes intersect is analysed. With efficient algorithms forits construction in hand, applications of supermeshing other than Galerkinprojections are discussed, focusing on the computation of diagnostics of simulationswhich employ adaptive remeshing. Examples demonstrating the effectivenessand efficiency of the presented algorithms are given throughout. The thesis closes with some conclusions and possibilities for future work.

=520  3\$aStrong opioids, morphine and oxycodone, are used in the management of moderate to severe cancer pain, but there is wide inter-individual variation in patients' response to these drugs. Here we identify the clinical and pharmacogenetic factors influencing individuals response and build a model that predicts a favourable clinical outcome to these pain relieving strategies. Two clinical studies were conducted. Firstly, 298 subjects were recruited to a prospective, observational case-control study; data were obtained on 205 morphine responders and 93 morphine non-responders, also known as "switchers". Secondly, a randomised control trial was established to compare the clinical response rates to morphine and oxycodone used as first line strong opioids for cancer pain; analysis was carried out on 100 subjects randomised to receive trial medications "A" and "B" respectively. Clinical, haematological, biochemical, metabolite and genotype data were collected on all subjects; metabolite samples were processed using high performance liquid chromatography and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in candidate genes was performed using sequence specific primer assays whilst other data were obtained by genome-wide SNP analysis. Clinical factors associated with response to strong opioids included age, plasma morphine and metabolite concentrations, concomitant medications and the presence of visceral pain. Genetic variation in the gene encoding the glutamate receptor subunit 2A was associated with response to morphine and a number of polymorphisms were associated with secondary clinical phenotypes. There was no difference in the number of subjects responding to trial medications but dose conversion ratios between trial medications were asymmetric suggestive of cross-tolerance. These findings support a clinical and pharmacogenetic basis of response to strong opioids but the factors influencing response to pain relieving strategies need further definition.

=520  3\$aThe Compact Muon Solenoid was designed to make discoveries at theTeV scale : to elucidate the nature of electroweak symmetry breakingand to search for physics beyond the Standard Model. For any suchdiscovery to be credible, it must first be demonstrated that the CMSdetector is understood. One mechanism to make this demonstration isto measure "standard candle" processes, such as W and Z production. This thesis describes preparations undertaken to make these measurementsusing the electron decay modes, with[derivative]Ldt = 10 pb-1 of collisiondata. The energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter was measuredin test beam data. An improved method of deriving the optimisedweights necessary for amplitude reconstruction is described. The measurement of electron charge using tracks is impaired by theelectron showering in the tracker material. A novel charge measurementtechnique that is complementary to the existing method was assessed. Missing transverse energy is a powerful discriminating variable forthe selection of W+/ -> e+/ [upsilon]e events, however it is difficult to simulateaccurately due to its global nature. The Ersatz Missing Energy methodwas developed to provide reliable and accurate descriptions of missingenergy from data using readily reconstructible [gamma]*/Z -> e+e- events. The method is described and evaluated. Finally, the measurement strategy for W and Z boson productioncross-sections in early data is outlined and analysed using simulateddata. Significant results can be obtained with only [derivative] Ldt = 10 pb-1.

=520  3\$aThe assessment of skeletal muscle toxicity is important in the safety evaluation of new chemical entities, particularly those used as lipid-lowering agents. As current strategies for assessing myopathy are based on in vivo measurements, which sometimes lack sensitivity and specificity, there is a need for biomarkers that better predict myopathy and also for an approach that is more amenable to high-throughput screening. Here, the use of cultured rat L6 myoblasts and myotubes was explored in combination with a variety of techniques to identify potential biomarkers, following exposure to a known experimental myotoxicant, 2,3,5,6 tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD), or a highly selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ agonist, 4-[2-(3-fluoro-4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-4-methyl-thiazol-5-ylmethylsulfanyl]-2-methyl-phenoxy-acetic acid (GWδ). The use of candidate biomarkers, based on the utilisation of a variety of established and putative markers of myopathy, proved to be of little additional value in myoblasts treated with low concentrations of TMPD. In myotubes, however, intracellular levels of aldolase and creatine kinase appeared to be responsive markers. Proteomic analysis of TMPD and GWδ-treated skeletal muscle cells using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF-MS) showed changes in the levels of 16 protein ions in myoblasts and 12 changes in myotubes, although SELDI-TOF-MS did not lend itself to the conclusive identification of these ions. Analysis of the muscle cell proteins using label-free quantitative proteomics was able to simultaneously quantify TMPD-induced changes and identify the proteins involved. In this way, 8 proteins in myoblasts and 10 proteins in myotubes were discovered to be the most responsive proteins to treatment. Changes in the levels of Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) alpha in myoblasts and Myosin light chain 2 in myotubes were confirmed by immunoblotting, and these proteins were also responsive to treatment with GWδ and pravastatin. In conclusion, cultured skeletal muscle cells were responsive to the effects of potentially myotoxic agents, and proteomics was successful in identifying and quantifying proteins that may act as biomarkers of effect.

=520  3\$aHepatic lipogenesis and the secretion of very low-density lipoproteins are severely perturbed in orotic-acid fed rats. Proteomic analysis of this rodent fatty liver identified a protein enriched in the microsomal fraction. The protein contains a domain of unknown function 108 (DUF 108) and is found to compose a complete protein in archaebacteria and mammalian species, but a single domain in Caenorhabditis elegans protein Q19527. The cDNA for human protein A6ND91 was cloned and stable rat hepatoma cell lines, expressing recombinant A6ND91-FLAG tagged protein were produced. Significant increases in de-novo lipogenesis and secretion of triglyceride-enriched lipoproteins were observed. This thesis considers A6ND91 protein in terms of structure and proposed function. Previous work has indicated that the homologous protein Thermatoga maritime 1643 (TM1643) possesses NAD+ or NADP+-dependent dehydrogenase activity towards L-Aspartate, producing NADH or NADPH plus iminoaspartate, a substrate that rapidly degrades into oxaloacetate (OAA) and ammonia. In this thesis, analyses of primary and predicted secondary structure of A6ND91 and TM1643 revealed that residues binding NAD+/NADP+ and the proposed active catalytic residue, Histidine198, are conserved. Northern-blot analysis identified A6ND91 is highly expressed in human liver, moderately in kidney, and at low levels in the brain. Western-blot analysis identified that A6ND91 is predominately localised to the cytosol, with minimal amounts in the microsomal fraction. Proteomic analysis revealed that A6ND91 contains a phosphorylated residue, Serine168. The kinase potentially responsible for phosphorylation of the residue is Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3), a well-characterised enzyme involved in regulation of glycogen metabolism and acetyl-CoA production. Microarray analyses indicate that over-expression of A6ND91 perturbs activity of several metabolic pathways involved in carboxylic acid metabolism, cholesterol synthesis and complement activation. Closer inspection of the perturbed metabolic pathways revealed an overlap through the substrates OAA/pyruvate/acetyl-CoA. Assays were performed to establish the NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH redox state in cell lines expressing A6ND91. Results established that NAD+/NADH ratio was significantly reduced, suggesting that A6ND91 may operate as a dehydrogenase. Collectively, results suggest that L-Aspartate dehydrogenase activity of TM1643 is conserved in human A6ND91, playing a key role in hepatic lipid and energy metabolism through the production of OAA and its subsequent conversion to pyruvate/acetyl-CoA and cholesterol.

=520  3\$aThe ultimate aim of research into computer vision is designing a system which interpretsits surrounding environment in a similar way the human can do effortlessly. However, thestate of technology is far from achieving such a goal. In this thesis different components ofa computer vision system that are designed for the task of interpreting man-made scenes,in particular images of buildings, are described. The flow of information in the proposedsystem is bottom-up i.e., the image is first segmented into its meaningful components andsubsequently the regions are labelled using a contextual classifier. Starting from simple observations concerning the human vision system and the gestalt lawsof human perception, like the law of ?good (simple) shape? and ?perceptual grouping?, ablob detector is developed, that identifies components in a 2D image. These componentsare convex regions of interest, with interest being defined as significant gradient magnitudecontent. An eye tracking experiment is conducted, which shows that the regions identifiedby the blob detector, correlate significantly with the regions which drive the attention ofviewers. Having identified these blobs, it is postulated that a blob represents an object, linguisticallyidentified with its own semantic name. In other words, a blob may contain a window adoor or a chimney in a building. These regions are used to identify and segment higherorder structures in a building, like facade, window array and also environmental regionslike sky and ground. Because of inconsistency in the unary features of buildings, a contextual learning algorithmis used to classify the segmented regions. A model which learns spatial and topologicalrelationships between different objects from a set of hand-labelled data, is used. Thismodel utilises this information in a MRF to achieve consistent labellings of new scenes.

=520  3\$aIn this thesis I focus on the development and application of hidden Markov model(HMM) to solve problems in statistical genetics. Our method, based on a HMM,models the joint haplotype structure in the samples, where the parameters in themodel are estimated by the Baum-Welch EM algorithm. Also, the model does notrequire pre-defined blocks or a sliding window scheme to define haplotype boundaries. Thus our method is computationally efficient and applicable for either thewhole genome sequence or the candidate gene sequence. The first application of this model is for disease association testing using inferredancestral haplotypes. We employed a HMM to cluster haplotypes into groups ofpredicted common ancestral haplotypes from diploid genotypes. The results fromsimulation studies show that our method greatly outperforms single-SNP analysesand has greater power than a haplotype-based method, CLADHC, in most simulation scenarios. The second application is for inferring haplotypic phase and topredict missing genotypes in polyploid organisms. Using a simulation study wedemonstrate that the method provides accurate estimates of haplotypic phase andmissing genotypes for diploids, triploids and tetraploids. The third application isfor joint CNV/SNP haplotype and missing data inference. The results are veryencouraging for this application. With the increasing availability of genotype data in both diploid and polyploidorganisms, we believe that our programs can facilitate the investigation of geneticvariations in genome-wide scale studies.

=520  3\$aWhenever we perform a movement and interact with objects in our environment, our centralnervous system (CNS) adapts and controls the redundant system of muscles actuatingour limbs to produce suitable forces and impedance for the interaction. As modern robotsare increasingly used to interact with objects, humans and other robots, they too requireto continuously adapt the interaction forces and impedance to the situation. This thesisinvestigated the motor mechanisms in humans through a series of technical developmentsand experiments, and utilized the result to implement biomimetic motor behaviours ona robot. Original tools were first developed, which enabled two novel motor imagingexperiments using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The first experimentinvestigated the neural correlates of force and impedance control to understand the controlstructure employed by the human brain. The second experiment developed a regressor freetechnique to detect dynamic changes in brain activations during learning, and appliedthis technique to investigate changes in neural activity during adaptation to force fieldsand visuomotor rotations. In parallel, a psychophysical experiment investigated motoroptimization in humans in a task characterized by multiple error-effort optima. Finallya computational model derived from some of these results was implemented to exhibithuman like control and adaptation of force, impedance and movement trajectory in arobot.

=520  3\$aThe ability to distinguish between regions with different material properties is essentialwhen numerically modelling many physical systems. Using a dual control volumemesh that avoids the problem of corner coupling, the HyperC face value scheme is extendedto multiple dimensions and applied as a device for material advection on unstructuredsimplex meshes. The new scheme performs well at maintaining sharp interfacesbetween materials and is shown to produce small advection errors, comparable to thoseof standard material advection methods on structured meshes. To further minimise numericaldiffusion of material interfaces a total variation bounded flux limiter, UltraC, isdefined using a normalised variable diagram. Combining the material tracking scheme with dynamically adapting meshes, the useof a minimally dissipative bounded projection algorithm for interpolating fields fromthe old mesh to the new, optimised mesh is demonstrated that conserves the mass ofeach material. More generally, material conservation during the advection process isensured through the coupling of the material tracking scheme to the momentum and massequations. A new element pair for the discretisation of velocity and pressure is proposedthat maintains the stability of the system while conserving the mass of materials. When modelling multiple materials the use of independent advection algorithms foreach material can lead to the problem of non-physical material overlap. A novel coupledflux limiter is developed to overcome this problem. This automatically generalisesto arbitrary numbers of materials. Using the fully coupled (and rigorously verified)multi-material model, several geophysically relevant simulations are presented examiningthe generation of waves by landslides. The model is validated by demonstratingclose agreement between model predictions and experimental results of wave generation,propagation and run-up. The simulations also showcase the powerful capabilities of anunstructured, adaptive multi-material model in real world scenarios.

=520  3\$aBasic properties of critical points in two dimensions are reviewed and related to thevelocity and acceleration field of two-dimensional turbulence. A direct numerical simulation(DNS) of two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence with an inverse energycascade and a k?5/3 power law is used to study critical points of these fields. The velocity stagnation point based pair separation model of Goto and Vassilicos(S Goto and J C Vassilicos, 2004, New J.Phys., 6, p.65) is revisited and placed on asound mathematical foundation. The DNS is used to study the time-asymmetry observedbetween forward and backward separation. A new method has been employed to obtainvalues for the Richardson constants and the ratio of them for the backwards and forwardscase, which is gb/gf = (0.92?0.03) and hence, exhibits a qualitatively different behaviourfrom pair separation in three-dimensional turbulence, where gb > gf (J Berg et al. , 2006,Phys. Rev. E, 74(1), p.016304). An explanation for this behaviour based on the timeasymmetryrelated to the inverse versus forward energy cascade is suggested. Zero Acceleration Points (ZAPs) and flow structures around them are studied usingthe same DNS. A well-defined classification of ZAPs in terms of the acceleration gradienttensor?s (?a) invariants is presented. About half of all ZAPs are Anti-ZAPs (withdet[?a] < 0) and the number of vortical and straining ZAPs (with det[?a] > 0) is aboutthe same. Vortical and straining ZAPs are swept by the local fluid velocity to a goodstatistical approximation whereas Anti-ZAPs are not. The average life-time of ZAPsseems to scale with the time-scale of the smallest eddies in the turbulence, though ZAPs(in particular vortical ones) are able to survive up to a few integral time scales. The newZAP classification can also be applied to extended flow regions and a discussion of thelength-scales and sizes characterising these regions and the distances between ZAPs isgiven.

=520  3\$aEast Asian lacquer (urushi) is a natural, thermosetting polymer, characterised by its durability and gloss. Prolonged exposure to light, however, causes photodegradation, which initiates microcracking in the surface layers. Accumulation of dirt, grease, or non-original materials, such as varnishes applied during attempted restoration, contributes to deterioration of the lacquer's appearance through discolouration. This build up must be removed in order to conserve affected pieces, and the potential use of solvents to achieve this aim is investigated here. This work presents a review of the chemistry of this unique material, and the distinction between different East Asian lacquers is investigated. Valuable, rare lacquer samples could not be taken from naturally aged museum pieces in order to investigate the applicability of solvents in cleaning conservation processes, and so the damage featured on the models used was recreated artificially. The advantages and limitations of such an approach are assessed in terms of the practical value of the resulting samples as credible models compared to the naturally aged material. In free film studies, solubility parameters were determined for a range of lacquers, and the morphological changes that result from solvent exposure are also investigated to determine potential 'safe' solvents for conservation cleaning. These studies show that most solvents are damaging to photodegraded lacquers to some extent, and the possible risks must be assessed against the need for removal of a damaging layer. The findings reported here have implications for the choice of solvents used in conservation cleaning, but other solvent properties and behaviours must be considered along with these data when identifying the least damaging, yet effective solvents.

=520  3\$aThe reverse micelle (RM) extraction of human IgG4 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), humanized IgG4 MAb B72.3 Fab fragments and horse heart cytochrome-c was investigated. The effects of system parameters on forward (FE) and backward (BE) extraction was examined, and optimal extraction conditions were determined. Sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT), bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate (HDEHP), isooctane and corn oil were the model surfactants and solvents. Precipitate formation was investigated, and non-ionic (polyoxyethylene(4) lauryl ether i.e. Brij 30) and counterionic (trioctylmethylammonium chloride i.e. TOMAC) surfactants were assessed to reduce precipitate formation and increase extraction yields. Protein in the precipitate was measured using acetone precipitation. Conventional RM extraction of IgG4 for AOT- and HDEHP-isooctane resulted in yields of up to 99% FE, 58% BE for AOT-isooctane, and 92% BE for HDEHP-isooctane. It was found for AOT-isooctane with TOMAC for cytochrome-c 81% FE and 98% BE; and 41% FE and 85% BE for AOT-isooctane with Brij 30 and TOMAC, 56% FE and 71% BE for AOT-corn oil, 62% FE and 89% BE for HDEHP-isooctane, and 57% FE and 59% BE for HDEHP-corn oil with TOMAC for Fab fragments. Hollow fibre membrane (HFM) extraction of cytochrome-c resulted in complete FE and 40% BE with TOMAC; and with Fab fragments resulted in 99% FE and 79% BE for AOT, and in 88% FE and 46% BE for HDEHP with Brij 30. HFM FE using two aqueous phases showed that the quantity of Fab fragments adsorbed to the membrane surface and/or stuck in the membrane pores were negligible. Structural analysis revealed that precipitate formation during HFM module extraction was not an issue compared to conventional FE, where it structurally damaged and prevented the Fab fragments and MAbs from successfully transferring into the RM phase. RM phase water content analysis from both extraction methods confirmed that RM extraction was successful.

=520  3\$aEver-increasing energy consumption and consequent extensive greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions are two major urgent problems faced by all human beings in the 21st century. As a major contributor, the energy production section appears to be the most suitable fieldwhere further improvements could be explored to tackle these problems. Polygenerationis a typical type of next generation energy production technology with higher energyefficiency and lower/zero GHG emissions. However, methodologies guiding an efficientand stable transition from our existing energy systems to more advanced ones are stilllacking. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a generic modelling and optimization frameworkto guide planning and design of energy systems. This framework of methodologies ad-dresses the following issues arising in the planning and designing of energy systems: a)decision making at both strategic planning level and process design level; b) selection ofroadmaps, technologies, and types of equipment from many available options; c) planningor design according to both economic and environmental criteria; d) planning or designunder inevitable and unpredictable future uncertainty. The thesis is organized as follows: first, a review of energy systems is presented, followedby methodologies of energy systems engineering and their applications. Then a sectionof polygeneration process modelling is provided, at both strategic planning and processdesign levels, comprising superstructure representations of polygeneration energy systemsat different levels, implementations of the superstructure based modelling strategy usingmixed-integer programming, multi-objective optimization for the optimal process designaccording to both economic and environmental criteria, and optimization under uncer-tainty to account the impacts of future uncertainties at the planning/design stage and toincrease the flexibility and robustness of a process design. Finally, major achievements ofthis work are summarised and future research directions are recommended.

=520  3\$aThis thesis develops modelling and algorithmic approaches for two Project SchedulingProblems. We first consider the Discrete Time-Cost Tradeoff Problem (DTCTP)which involves determining an execution mode for each project activity associatedto a time-cost pair so that either deadline or budget restrictions are satisfied. Anew, path-based formulation is proposed which is subsequently solved using an exactcutting plane algorithm enhanced with speed-up techniques. Extensive computationalresults demonstrate that the algorithm can optimally solve some of the hardest andlargest instances in the literature. By introducing uncertainty, we construct the stochastic DTCTP with static modes,under a Two-Stage Stochastic Programming approach; the first-stage determines themodes while the second performs activity scheduling according to observed outcomes. The formulation is solved via an exact decomposition-based algorithm, which is shownto converge fast to optimality through extensive experimentation; the benefits of using stochastic models over traditional deterministic approaches which only considerexpected values are also confirmed. A Multi-Stage formulation for the stochastic dynamic DTCTP is also proposed,which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first in the field. This allows adjusting themode decisions according to observations and its complexity is due to the presenceof decision-dependent uncertainty as the decisions influence the time discovery of therandom variables. A Branch-and-Bound methodology is developed using lower andupper bounds and dominance rules and its generic features are discussed. Our extensive computational study highlights the value of flexibility associated to dynamicmodels and tests the performance of the proposed approaches in solving computationally difficult, non-standard, stochastic programs. The final part of this thesis focuses on the Stochastic Resource-Constrained ProjectScheduling Problem, which involves scheduling project activities under limited resources and uncertain durations. A solution methodology is presented, implementedand computationally evaluated using randomly generated test instances. Computational results are reported.

=520  3\$aThe research focuses on the development of mathematical models fordescribing transient flows within and between connected fluid-filledvessels. The fluid mechanics of connected vessels is of broad interestand numerous examples may be found in industry, the built environment and the laboratory. This work focuses primarily on the interaction between three connecting vessels and considers two main areas ofapplication: (i) the so-called `double-tank method, as used by experimental fluid dynamicists to stratify environments, and (ii) the passivetransient ventilation of multi-storey buildings. An analytical description of the double-tank method, a classic example of liquid exchanges under controlled (constant) flow rates betweenhorizontally connected vessels, was developed. Subsequently, a newtechnique was proposed, modelled and tested which enabled a broaderrange of density stratifications to be set up and without the use ofpumps. This technique enabled liquids to drain freely under gravityfrom one vessel to another - the rates of liquid transfer no longer constant but functions of the instantaneous liquid depths. Modelling the fluid mechanics of multi-storey building ventilation addedadditional tiers of complexity as air and heat exchanged between roomsdrive turbulent mixing and there is complex feedback between the individual rooms. Three vessels were again considered, two storeys connected to a common atrium, and the development of the buoyancy-driven flow following the activation of heat sources was investigated. A description of the transient response of the ventilation in an atriumbuilding leading to a steady state, as typically achieved during thecourse of a day, was developed. Wind pressure variations and solarheat gains in the atrium were also incorporated. The effect of atria geometry on the ventilation of adjoining rooms was established andshown to be analogous to either an `assisting or an `opposing wind. When `opposing , the ventilation flow rate reduced. For a strongly `opposing atrium, a reversal in the direction of flow through the storeyoccurred, revealing the possibility of multiple flow regimes during thetransients - the dynamics of which were explored. Finally, the buildingventilation model was generalised to n storeys (n > 2) connecting toa common atrium. Controversially, the implications of the predictionsindicate that current atrium designs do not guarantee enhanced flowas is generally accepted.

=520  3\$aThe existence of a significant non-baryonic component to the universe is widely accepted,with worldwide efforts underway trying to detect this so-called dark matter. The ZEPLIN detectors utilise liquid xenon as a target medium in the search of the expected rare interactions of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, with ordinary baryonic matter. The neutralino, arising in supersymmetric extensions to the standard model of particle physics, provides a particularly well-motivated candidate. The ZEPLIN-II and ZEPLIN-III experiments, operate in two-phase mode (liquid/gas), measuring both the scintillation and ionisation signatures produced during an interaction. These instruments form the basis of this thesis. The ZEPLIN-II experiment was operated underground at the Boulby Underground Laboratory, culminating in a WIMP search run lasting 57 days. Some key operational aspects are discussed, and a full description of the data analysis is given, which yielded a competitive upper limit on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering crosssection with a minimum of 6.6x10⁻⁷ pb for a 65 GeV/c² WIMP with 90% confidence. Subsequently, a smaller collaboration proceeded with the commissioning and operation of ZEPLIN-III at Boulby. The detector was operated stably for 12 months, culminating in the first science run, which excluded a cross-section above 7.7 x 10⁻⁸ pb for a 55GeV/c² WIMP. This placed ZEPLIN-III as one of the world's leading WIMP search experiments. Along with the WIMP search results, the data collected from these instruments have been exploited to extract information about the underlying xenon physics processes,which will play an important role in design of future systems. This includes the first quantitative measurements of single electron emission in a two-phase noble gas detector, studies of the field dependence of their response and of the anti-correlation between the scintillation and ionisation channels.

=520  3\$aWhen intense and few-cycle laser pulses interact with an atomic/molecular beam highorderAbove Threshold Ionisation (HATI) can take place. The resulting electrons can bere-scattered from the parent atoms/molecules and gain kinetic energy. The HATI electronscontain information about the atomic/molecular structure thus providing a method toprobe atomic and molecular dynamics with sub-fs temporal and sub-angstr?m spatialresolution. In this thesis the development of a Velocity Map Imaging apparatus capable of measuringthe two-dimensional (2D) projection of the velocity distribution of electrons with energiesup to 400 eV is described. This device was implemented with a molecular beam apparatusto study the electron re-scattering process that occurs when atoms/molecules are subjectedto strong laser fields. Time-of-fight measurements were carried out to find the molecularbeam. To perform the experiments a method to generate intense and few-cycle pulsesbased on hollow fibre pulse compression has been implemented. Pulses of 14 fs withenergies of 500 ?J have been measured in a differentially pumped fibre set-up, with inputpulses of 42 fs and 700 ?J using a home-made Frequency-Resolved Optical Gating device. The performance of the VMI apparatus was investigated by first studying the ATI ringsformed by low energy electrons. Then, a study of the high energy electrons was carried outin different gases and re-scattered electrons with energies up to 100 eV were measured. The photoelectron spectra recorded with linearly polarised laser exhibit a plateau with acut-off at 10 UP that is a characteristic of the re-scattering process. The observation of rescatteredelectrons was confirmed by two techniques: comparison of the data obtainedwith vertical polarisation (re-scattering) and circular polarisation (no re-scattering) andanalysis of the structure in the angular distribution obtained in Xenon.

=520  3\$aThe transmission of the malaria parasite Plasmodium is governed by a complex developmental cycle. This PhD thesis describes the transcriptional profiling of the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei developmental migration through its A. gambiae vector. The study was conducted in vivo, using a near complete P. berghei genome microarray platform. Emphasis was placed on the oocyst stage, as little is known about the genes implicated in the ookinete to oocyst transition, and oocyst maturation. The data presented here provide novel transcriptional information about Plasmodium transmission. The analysis revealed a large shift in gene utilisation as the parasite makes its transition from the motile ookinete to the sessile oocyst. Furthermore, this work has shown that different sets of co-regulated genes are important for early and late oocyst development. In addition, this PhD thesis outlines the characterisation of a novel Plasmodium formin-like protein essential for rodent malaria transmission named the male inherited sporulation factor important for transmission (misfit). MISFIT is expressed in the early mosquito stages, where the protein localises to the parasite nucleus. Misfit exhibits an absolute requirement for paternal inheritance, which is in accordance with an observed male-biased expression pattern. pbmisfitΔ ookinetes display significant ultrastructural and gene expression defects and fail to complete zygotic meiosis. However, pbmisfitΔ ookinetes retain functionality and can successfully cross the midgut epithelial barrier. In contrast, mosquito infections with pbmisfitΔ resulted in an arrest immediately upon ookinete-oocyst transformation, where defective oocysts fail to sporulate. An essential role in chromosome segregation during mitosis/meiosis is postulated for MISFIT. In conclusion, the work presented in this thesis has established the ookinete-oocyst transition as a major cell cycle check point during malaria transmission and identified misfit as the first male inherited Plasmodium gene known to affect development post-fertilisation.

=520  3\$aLinear power amplifiers used to implement the Ultra-Wideband standard must be backed off from optimum power efficiency to meet the standard specifications and the power efficiency suffers. The problem of low efficiency can be mitigated by polar modulation. Digital polar architectures have been employed on numerous wireless standards like GSM, EDGE, and WLAN, where the fractional bandwidths achieved are only about 1%, and the power levels achieved are often in the vicinity of 20 dBm. Can the architecture be employed on wireless standards with low-power and high fractional bandwidth requirements and yet achieve good power efficiency? To answer this question, this thesis studies the application of a digital polar transmitter architecture with parallel amplifier stages for UWB. The concept of the digital transmitter is motivated and inspired by three factors. First, unrelenting advances in the CMOS technology in deep-submicron process and the prevalence of low-cost Digital Signal processing have resulted in the realization of higher level of integration using digitally intensive approaches. Furthermore, the architecture is an evolution of polar modulation, which is known for high power efficiency in other wireless applications. Finally, the architecture is operated as a digital-to-analog converter which circumvents the use of converters in conventional transmitters. Modeling and simulation of the system architecture is performed on the Agilent Advanced Design System Ptolemy simulation platform. First, by studying the envelope signal, we found that envelope clipping results in a reduction in the peak-to-average power ratio which in turn improves the error vector magnitude performance (figure of merit for the study). In addition, we have demonstrated that a resolution of three bits suffices for the digital polar transmitter when envelope clipping is performed. Next, this thesis covers a theoretical derivation for the estimate of the error vector magnitude based on the resolution, quantization and phase noise errors. An analysis on the process variations - which result in gain and delay mismatches - for a digital transmitter architecture with four bits ensues. The above studies allow RF designers to estimate the number of bits required and the amount of distortion that can be tolerated in the system. Next, a study on the circuit implementation was conducted. A DPA that comprises 7 parallel RF amplifiers driven by a constant RF phase-modulated signal and 7 cascode transistors (individually connected in series with the bottom amplifiers) digitally controlled by a 3-bit digitized envelope signal to reconstruct the UWB signal at the output. Through the use of NFET models from the IBM 130-nmtechnology, our simulation reveals that our DPA is able to achieve an EVM of -22 dB. The DPA simulations have been performed at 3.432 GHz centre frequency with a channel bandwidth of 528 MHz, which translates to a fractional bandwidth of 15.4%. Drain efficiencies of 13.2/19.5/21.0% have been obtained while delivering -1.9/2.5/5.5 dBm of output power and consuming 5/9/17 mW of power. In addition, we performed a yield analysis on the digital polar amplifier, based on unit-weighted and binary-weighted architecture, when gain variations are introduced in all the individual stages. The dynamic element matching method is also introduced for the unit-weighted digital polar transmitter. Monte Carlo simulations reveal that when the gain of the amplifiers are allowed to vary at a mean of 1 with a standard deviation of 0.2, the binary-weighted architecture obtained a yield of 79%, while the yields of the unit-weighted architectures are in the neighbourhood of 95%. Moreover, the dynamic element matching technique demonstrates an improvement in the yield by approximately 3%. Finally, a hardware implementation for this architecture based on software-defined arbitrary waveform generators is studied. In this section, we demonstrate that the error vector magnitude results obtained with a four-stage binary-weighted digital polar transmitter under ideal combining conditions fulfill the European Computer Manufacturers Association requirements. The proposed experimental setup, believed to be the first ever attempted, confirm the feasibility of a digital polar transmitter architecture for Ultra-Wideband. In addition, we propose a number of power combining techniques suitable for the hardware implementation. Spatial power combining, in particular, shows a high potential for the digital polar transmitter architecture. The above studies demonstrate the feasibility of the digital polar architecture with good power efficiency for a wideband wireless standard with low-power and high fractional bandwidth requirements.

=520  3\$aAn investigation into turbulent reacting flows in an opposed jet geometry and a suddenexpansion duct has been performed. For the opposed jet geometry, measurements ofthe velocity and reaction progress variable were obtained in lean premixed flames. Bothvelocity and scalar measurements were taken using PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry).Three gaseous fuels (methane, propane and ethylene) and three liquid fuels (JP-10,cyclopentane and cyclopentene) were considered for a range of equivalence ratios. Thebroad range of fuels enabled an investigation of the effect of different fuel reactivities onthe velocity field and flame location and also allowed the effect of the Lewis number on flame extinction to be investigated. Preliminary work included isothermal measurements of the flow between and inside thenozzles. The use of fractal grids inside the nozzle increased turbulence intensities at thenozzle exit by 100% and turbulent Reynolds numbers between 50 - 220 were achieved. Velocity and normal stress components were measured with attention focused on theinlet boundary, along the burner centreline and the stagnation plane. A circular duct, incorporating a sudden expansion step, was also used to investigate theeffect of swirl on pressure oscillations within the duct, the lean flammability limits andthe NOx emissions. Measurements were performed for stratified flow conditions usingmethane as a fuel. The results show that excessive swirl leads to an increase in localstrain in the vicinity of the expansion step and makes the flame more prone to localextinction. Moderate swirl was found to lower the amplitudes of the pressure oscillationsclose to global extinction and also to decrease the lean extinction limit of the stratified flow conditions. However, it did not decrease the overall equivalence ratio of flows witha richer core and a leaner annulus. Flows with only air in the core flow led to an overallequivalence ratio as lean as 0.3 for methane compared with 0.6 for the uniform flow. Stratification with a fuel rich core flow and a leaner annular flow led to an increase inNOx emissions due to locally increased temperatures. The addition of moderate swirlenhanced mixing of the annular and the core flows, which resulted in a more uniformfuel distribution close to the step and a reduction in NOx-levels up to 50%.

=520  3\$aUninhabited combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) are intended for carrying out high-riskcombat missions with a high degree of precision, effectiveness and efficiency andwithout endangering pilots? lives. An air refuelling system for UCAVs could bringout their full potential in wartime action, by extending their range capability andincreasing their airborne time. Hence, the main aim of this PhD research programmewas to develop a design and optimisation methodology for an innovative conceptconsisting of a large uninhabited tanker and a number of UCAVs flying in a closeformation, with an optimised and fully autonomous air refuelling capability. Theclose formation flight of this tanker and UCAVs combination provides aerodynamicbenefits which together with an optimised air-to-air refuelling sequence will result ina significantly extended combat radius and capability without unnecessarilycompromising the UCAVs? physical size. With a stealth design approach, theproposed combination could fly directly to a faraway destination without anyintermediate stops, hence minimizing any risk of detection, with significant fuel andtime savings. To fully exploit the potential advantages the above combination, boththe autonomous tanker and the UCAV concepts have been designed throughspecially developed and separate synthesis methodologies and each aircraft wassubsequently optimised for its respective operational role. An investigation intoformation flight aerodynamics has also been conducted. A method for evaluating theassociated aerodynamic benefits has been developed using a modified vortex-latticeapproach, to automatically locate an optimal formation position for each aircraft inflight. A further method has also been developed to optimise the air refuellingsequence of the UCAVs by utilising the design synthesis and formation flight resultsaiming to maximise a range objective function. The above design synthesis andoptimisation methodologies have all been integrated into an automated programwritten in Visual Basic. NET, featuring Graphical User Interfaces for simpler, fasterand repetitive implementation.

=520  3\$aDuring use, carbonaceous material or ?coke? can deposit on catalysts resulting in decreasedactivity and lifetime. In this thesis, the results of investigations into the structure anddistribution of coke, on hydrocracking catalysts, are reported. The material consists of zeoliteY, alumina binder as well as tungsten and nickel sulfide. An extensive investigation regarding the preparation of the catalysts for electron microscopywas carried out. It was established that microtoming produced specimen damage and henceregions of porosity, zeolite and alumina binder were difficult to identify. Single beam anddual beam focused ion beam (FIB) milling produced intact specimens and the spatialdistribution of the catalysts was maintained, although thinner specimens were obtained usingthe latter technique. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping identified gallium andplatinum as artefacts in specimens that had been prepared by a single beam FIB system. Inaddition, argon ion beam milling was used and this technique produced large regions of thin material. Energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) was employed to reveal thedistribution of carbon in the catalyst. Carbon was identified on alumina binder, zeolite grainsand meso-/macro-pores, although the distribution of carbon was generally not uniform as it isdetermined by the density and strength of acid sites, geometry of pores and the proximity ofmetal sulfide crystallites. All of these factors, especially pores size and shape, vary in the catalysts. Coke is thought to consist of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Electron energy-lossspectroscopy (EELS), of selected PAH standards, was performed to obtain the electronenergy-loss near edge structure (ELNES) of carbon. In addition, the ELNES of four PAHswas modelled using multiple scatter calculations. EELS of the catalysts revealed that PAHsare present on zeolitic components but ELNES was not identified on the alumina binder. Thisis possibly because alumina contains larger pores than zeolite Y; therefore larger moleculescan diffuse into the alumina structure, which increases the chemical variety of the cokespecies as the molecules are not sterically impeded.

=520  3\$aThe power spectrum describes the fluctuations in the Universe and encodes muchof the cosmological information. Hence measuring different types of power spectrais of great importance in cosmology today. In this thesis we try to constraintwo of these power spectra, the primordial power spectrum and the galaxy powerspectrum. First we analyse the binning of the primordial power spectrum. Theprimordial power spectrum describes the initial perturbations in the Universe whicheventually grew into the large-scale structure we observe today, and thereby providesan indirect probe of inflation or other structure-formation mechanisms. Wewill investigate which scales the primordial power spectrum can best be probed, inaccordance with the knowledge about other cosmological parameters. The aim isto find the most informative way of measuring the primordial power spectrum atdifferent length scales, using different types of surveys, such as Planck and SDSS(Bright Red Galaxy). For this we make use of the Fisher matrix formalism, principalcomponent analysis and Hermitian square root of the Fisher matrix. This methodof binning of the primordial power spectrum is then applied to the reconstruction ofthis power spectrum from WMAP and simulated Planck data. Here a new methodfor the reconstructing, directly from observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB), is introduced. Finally, we investigate the optimal observing strategyfor measuring galaxy/matter power spectrum. These power spectra are of great importancein cosmology. Measuring this spectrum will enable us to measure othercosmological parameters. If we are only interested in the large scale power spectrumthen we might gain more by sparsely observing a larger patch of sky, for the sameobserving time, rather than observing a smaller contiguous area. We will investigatethe advantages and disadvantages of this strategy using Bayesian ExperimentalDesign.

=520  3\$aWith an estimated 4.1 billion subscribers around the world, the mobile phone offers a uniqueopportunity to sense and understand human behaviour from location, co-presence and communicationdata. While the benefit of modelling this unprecedented amount of data is widelyrecognised, a number of challenges impede the development of accurate behaviour models. Inthis thesis, we identify and address two modelling problems and show that their considerationimproves the accuracy of behaviour inference. We first examine the modelling of long-range dependencies in human behaviour. Human behaviourmodels only take into account short-range dependencies in mobile phone time series. Using information theory, we quantify long-range dependencies in mobile phone time series forthe first time, demonstrate that they exhibit periodic oscillations and introduce novel tools toanalyse them. We further show that considering what the user did 24 hours earlier improvesaccuracy when predicting user behaviour five hours or longer in advance. The second problem that we address is the modelling of temporal variations in human behaviour. The time spent by a user on an activity varies from one day to the next. In order torecognise behaviour patterns despite temporal variations, we establish a methodological connectionbetween human behaviour modelling and biological sequence alignment. This connectionallows us to compare, cluster and model behaviour sequences and introduce novel features forbehaviour recognition which improve its accuracy. The experiments presented in this thesis have been conducted on the largest publicly availablemobile phone dataset labelled in an unsupervised fashion and are entirely repeatable. Furthermore,our techniques only require cellular data which can easily be recorded by today s mobilephones and could benefit a wide range of applications including life logging, health monitoring,customer profiling and large-scale surveillance.

=520  3\$aMarine protected areas (MPAs) are the dominant global strategy to counter widespread coral reef degradation, which threatens these coral reef ecosystems, the biodiversity they support, and the direct and indirect benefits they provision for millions of stakeholders, many of whom are in developing countries and have a high reliance on natural resources. Insufficient understanding of the conditions that enable MPAs to achieve their conservation and development goals means MPAs are yet to achieve their full potential. Similarly, inadequate awareness of the distributional aspects MPAs generate can leading to conflict and ultimately MPA failure. This research explores the links between two key themes of MPAs; efficiency and equity. A local case study in Belize is used to explore the ability of a MPA to provide a suite of benefits (net of costs) related to fishing, tourism, recreation and existence and bequest values in 2007. The values quantified demonstrate that the reserve represents an excellent return on conservation investment, particularly if non-user values are included. Survey effects associated with contingent valuation are found to be important and merit further research. Current entrance fees do capture much of the consumer surplus values which the reserve generates. Optimal fees are explored using the demand curve generated from the CVM. Non-use and local values, which are too rarely incorporated into MPA valuations are shown to be large, thus they are important to ensure well-informed decision making. A distributional analysis is undertaken, which quantifies transfers of wealth between stakeholders. This shows that incentives differ between stakeholders; where fishers, tour operators and international NGOs are incurring the direct costs. Contrary to what may be occurring elsewhere, the distribution of costs at local, national and international scales is found to be equivalent, although the benefits are highly skewed towards international stakeholders. Finally, I show that local community members, who will ultimately cause an MPA to fail or succeed, perceive costs and benefits fairly accurately. Thus the provision of local benefits is likely to improve MPA performance. A global coral reef MPA evaluation is undertaken, utilizing expert knowledge from MPAs in 33 countries. This constitutes the most comprehensive coral reef MPA performance evaluation to be carried out to date with a single methodology. MPA performance is shown to vary widely and to be unrelated to MPAs aims. Conclusions as to which are the most effective MPAs are also frequently altered, when incorporating temporal changes and spatial comparisons (assessing the counterfactual case). This dataset is also used to explore the extent to which different facets of success are coupled. I find that socio-economic and ecological benefits do not always occur concurrently and that a better appreciation of trade-offs is needed. The large variation in sample outcomes is used to explore drivers of success, including MPA features, management actions and contextual variables. MPA features such as size and zoning are found to support widespread hypotheses about the drivers of effectiveness. A non-linear temporal component of performance is identified, as are interactions between MPA features and outcomes. The provision of direct and indirect community benefits emerges as a crucial component of success. Frequently however, threats beyond the control of management and those inside the MPA which stem from inadequate resources are found to be undermining the effectiveness of coral reef MPAs.

=520  3\$aA novel protein labelling strategy has been developed based on a chemical reaction knownas Native Chemical Ligation (NCL). NCL is a highly specific and facile reaction, ligating athioester specifically to an N-terminal cysteine residue and can be used to tag proteins in aselective and quantitative manner. This has advantages over traditional labelling methodssuch as use of green fluorescent protein: labelling with a small molecule is less likely tointerfere with the protein's native biological activity, and its physicochemical properties canbe fine-tuned by synthesis. The key challenge is generating the protein bearing an N-terminalcysteine. The strategy developed in this thesis utilises the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus 3C protease (3Cpro), a highly selective protease that cleaves at PAKQ X with no apparent specificity for the P1' position. To demonstrate the application of 3Cpro for NCL-mediated labelling, fluorescein was specifically ligated to the N-terminus of the PH domain of Protein Kinase B (PKB), which when defective is a key protagonist in a number of cancers. An expression-purification strategy was developed to express the protein as a fusion with a GST affinity tag, linked by the sequence PAKQC. The GST-PAKQC-PH protein was cleaved using 3Cpro and purified, yielding the N-terminal cysteine protein, C-PH, which was subsequently coupled to a fluorescein thioester via NCL. The labelled PH domain was successfully used as a probe of membrane bound phosphoinositol lipids in a fixed cell imaging assay. Suitable thioester tags are generated by converting an activated succinimide ester to a mercaptoethanesulfonate thioester using mercaptoethanesulfonate. This reaction was used to build up a labelling library of labels ranging from fluorescent dyes for imaging to biotin for pull-down studies, all of which were successfully ligated on the C-PH domain. This labelling strategy was then taken one step further to allow the specific labelling of the target from within a protein mixture. NCL is a generic method, requiring only a thioester and a cysteine N-terminus, therefore the versatility of this system can be exploited to create an easy to use labelling 'toolbox'. The constructs and chemical tools produced here should enable facile production of a wide range of N-terminally labelled recombinant proteins for a vast array of studies.

=520  3\$aMulti walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) possess properties that make them particularlyrelevant for sensing applications in both the gas and liquid phase. Thisstudy presents an evaluation of cheap readily available CVD grown MWCNTs foruse as fire gas sensors. Current fire detectors exploit heat and smoke detectors andit is hoped that the inclusion of gas detectors will increase the speed and reliabilityof detection. In order to prepare a variety of different MWCNTs a range of CVD synthesis wereemployed including an injected catalyst method where MWCNTs grew in densemats from quartz substrates, MWCNTs were also synthesised using a sputtered Fecatalyst layer with acetylene as the carbon source which enabled control over thepositioning of the growth. In each case, the growth parameters were varied untilaligned growth was achieved. Doping of MWCNTs was also carried out as this mayenhance and enable some control over the electrical properties of the CNTs; nitrogenwas also added as a dopant by including 1,4-diazine as a precursor, and the effectson morphology of the MWCNTs produced were studied. The chemistry of the surface is also known to affect the sensing properties of CNTs. A batch of MWCNTs produced via the injected catalyst method were purifed byacid reflux, base washing and high temperature vacuum annealing, then modifiedwith platinum or palladium metal nanoparticles via a reduction of the metal saltsunder hydrogen. MWCNTs were also coated with the polymer polyethyleneimineand with copperphthalocyanine. Prototype sensor devices were fabricated by electrophoretic deposition of these modified MWCNTs, and gas testing was carried out with the gases NO2, NH3, CO, H2and C3H6. The mechanisms of sensing were investigated by repeating the tests atdifferent temperatures, which revealed which sensing mechanisms were dominantand responses were compared between the differently modified MWCNTs. Sensorresponse was also investigated with a series of vapours to probe the dispersive andpolar interactions on the MWCNT walls.

=520  3\$aThe work presented in this thesis explores the feasibility of the Multiple Mapping Conditioning (MMC) approach and its closures for real (laboratory) flames. Three differentconfigurations with relatively high Reynolds numbers but without considerable degree ofextinction and re-ignition are investigated, and results are compared against experimentalmeasurements of mixing and reactive scalar fields and other commonly used models. MMC combines the probability density function (PDF) approach and the conditioningmethods via the application of a generalised mapping function to a prescribed referencespace. Stochastic and deterministic formulations of MMC exist. Both formulations havebeen explored here for the case of one dimensional Gaussian reference space that is associated with the evolution of mixture fraction. The chemically reactive species are implicitlyconditioned on mixture fraction, and their fluctuations around the conditional means areneglected for the deterministic approach and modelled for the stochastic approach. Regarding the velocity field evolution, the Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes equations aresolved with a k-[epsilon]turbulence model. In the deterministic context, this work evaluates the ability of MMC to provide accurate and consistent closures for the mixture fraction PDF and the conditional scalardissipation which do not rely on presumed shape functions for the PDF such as the commonly used [Beta]-PDF. Computed probability distributions agree well with measurements,and a detailed comparison of the modelled conditional and mean scalar dissipation withexperimental data and conventional closures demonstrate MMC?s potential. Predictions ofreactive species and temperature are in good agreement with experimental data and similar in quality to singly-conditioned, first-order CMC predictions. MMC therefore providesan attractive -since consistent- alternative approach for the modelling of scalar mixing inturbulent reacting flows. In the stochastic context the evolution of the reference space is described by a Markovprocess that is coupled with a full PDF method for joint scalar evolution. A modifiedIECM model is applied for the modelling of the mixing operator where the particles mixwith their means conditioned on the reference space. The formulation of the closure leadsto localness of mixing in the mixture fraction space and consequently localness is expectedto be improved in the composition space. Focus is given on the accurate prediction ofscattering around the conditional means. Results demonstrate the potential of the method,however some discrepancies are noted in the predictions that can probably be associatedwith the chemical mechanism and the uncertainties associated with the choice of the minordissipation time.

=520  3\$aFreshwater is a finite resource. Faced with this challenge in the 21st century, there is an urgent need to augment existing sources of freshwater with sustainable alternatives. By adopting innovative demand management, water efficiency and conservation strategies, smart economics and advanced water technologies, water sustainability can be achieved as well as water security. The thesis posits that a decentralised system, like rooftop RWH, is feasible as an additional freshwater source running parallel to supplement and/ or complement the existing centralised mains water supply system for non-potable use even in high technology countries. Singapore, an urban city with abundant rainfall in a developed country context, is selected as a case study. As more than 80% of Singapore population lives in high-rise public housing, the HDB flats, rooftop RWH would augment the freshwater supply for urban storm runoffs that are discharged to the sea and are not collected in the stormwater collection ponds or reservoirs. Considerable potable water and cost savings would result as at least 25% of the potable mains water presently used for toilet-flushing, irrigation and floor-washing purposes could be substituted by rainwater. The centralised mains water supply system, as the main freshwater supply in socio-economic terms, is questioned as roofwater, with comparative good water quality, can be for non-potable use and thus supplement to meet the increasing water demand. RWH being a decentralised system, with numerous scattered water points throughout a city, has greater flexibility and autonomy and is less vulnerable to disruption in a distribution system, biological warfare and terrorism. For RWH to be successful, it must be carefully planned and designed to meet specific needs and conditions. In addition to enhancing technical guidelines, a combination of legislation, together with incentives, taxes and penalties helps to promote RWH and to maximize the benefits of implementing these systems. RWH is an under-used technology and strategy that can provide multiple benefits. When successfully implemented, RWH in the Singapore model can help close the gap in the total water cycle. It shows that even in a highly developed technological country like Singapore, there is room for a low but environmentally sound technology like RWH to play an important and relevant role. It is hoped that the lessons learned in Singapore can be replicated in other similar situations on a global scale.

=520  3\$aPlastic pipeline systems have now become dominant for fuel-gas and water distribution networks. Although they have an impressive service record failures do occur, with Rapid Crack Propagation being characterised as the least probable but most potentially catastrophic one. This study investigates the effect of structural morphology and bulk residual strains on the RCP performance of polyethylene pipes, and proposes a new methodology for predicting a safe service envelope. During crack propagation in PE pipes, the fracture surface has two distinct regions;plane strain and plane stress. In addition to the Instrumented Charpy, ReversedCharpy, High Speed Double Torsion, Dynamic Mechanical Analysis and uniaxialtensile testing, S4 tests of extruded pipe specimens were employed in order toevaluate the structural and fracture parameters of pipe grade resins in these twofracture modes on pipe. A new experimental technique, which modified the pipebore crystallinity without altering the residual strain field (as evaluated from slitring tests) showed that the bore surface layer properties had much less influenceon RCP than previously thought. Parallel with the experimental work, modelingof the fracture mechanisms was also undertaken. Using previous models in thefield, such as the adiabatic decohesion model, the plane strain fracture toughnesswas evaluated while the plane stress fracture toughness was evaluated either fromthe Reversed Charpy or from the stability of adiabatic drawing in a tensile test. A mixed mode, temperature sensitive toughness was finally evaluated, leading toan overall fracture properties assessment for polyethylene pipes which could becompared directly to the crack driving force during RCP in pipe. By employing anew mathematical approach, which incorporated both the effects of residual strainsand pipe stiffness behind the pressure decay length, a previous basic analyticalRCP model was further developed and compared to more elaborate finite elementand finite volume solutions. The new results were also compared to S4 experimentsusing high-speed photography and showed that the new methodology could be employed by the end user even when testing facilities are not directly available.

=520  3\$aThe LKB1 protein kinase has previously been implicated in a number of major physiological processes including cell proliferation, polarity and energy metabolism. LKB1 is an upstream kinase for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and 12 members of the AMPK-related family of kinases. In this study, western blotting of LKB1 from various mouse tissues indicated the existence of two molecular weight bands in testis. This, along with the presence of a potential alternative exon at the 3? end of the gene, led to the discovery that an alternatively-spliced variant of LKB1 is present in mice. This new splice variant has been termed the ?short form? (LKB1S) and the original protein termed the ?long form? (LKB1L). The proteins are identical in sequence apart from the C-terminus. The overall aim of this study was to characterise the LKB1S protein; its activity, regulation and possible physiological function, using overexpression studies in mammalian cells and analysis of mice lacking LKB1S.An LKB1S-specific antibody was used to show that LKB1S is primarily expressed in testis. It was demonstrated, using overexpression studies, that both forms can activate AMPK, form an active complex with the regulatory proteins STRAD?, STRAD? and MO25 and have a similar sub-cellular localisation. The C-terminus of mouse/human LKB1L can be phosphorylated at serine 431/428 (Sapkota et al., 2001). This residue is absent from LKB1S and so the effect of phosphorylation was investigated to determine if this could lead to differences in activity between the splice forms. However, the results suggest that phosphorylation at this site does not affect the ability of LKB1L to activate AMPK in cells. Male mice lacking expression of LKB1S are infertile. The mice display severe sperm abnormalities and sperm counts are significantly reduced. Histological analysis of testis showed that although early spermatogenesis appears to progress normally, abnormalities become apparent later on, culminating in very few spermatozoa reaching the epididymis. One possible reason that has been investigated is that there is a defect in the release of mature sperm from the seminiferous epithelium (spermiation).

=520  3\$aPublic awareness on the impacts that micropollutants and emerging contaminants have on aquatic resources has increased in recent decades and has become a significant driver for reducing levels of contaminants in the environment. The most recent and comprehensive initiative of the European Union in the area of water protection is the Water Framework Directive (WFD), which entails the application of new technical standards for surface water quality. It has been reported that sewage treatment works (STWs) are a major source of micropollutants for receiving aquatic environments. As a result of this, STWs are increasingly becoming a target for regulatory and public pressure with regard to their discharges to the environment. The micropollutants and emerging contaminants considered in this thesis have been identified under the European Union as substances that are toxic, persistent, and likely to bioaccumulate. This thesis aimed to develop a model to estimate concentrations and loads of micropollutants and emerging contaminants at site specific STWs to aid the implementation of the WFD by 2015. The thesis also focused on a case study to evaluate the need for tertiary treatment to remove micropollutants and emerging contaminants using a detailed laboratory analysis to assess the removal ability of a selected tertiary treatment. The results of the model designed in this research were used as part of a risk assessment which focused on understanding the risk that site specific STWs posed to the environment, and on their removal efficiencies. The risk assessment enables the most at risk STWs to be prioritised for investment and will facilitate management options in seeking to satisfy the WFD. The thesis, through extensive research, also aimed to detail knowledge gaps present in the UK water industry regarding sources, pathways, fate, and behaviour of micropollutants and emerging contaminants. Finally, recommendations were outlined regarding future steps to help meet the requirements of the WFD.

=520  3\$aTotal shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) still suffers today from mid-term and long-term complications such as glenoid implant loosening, wear, humeral head subluxation/dislocation and implant fracture. Unlike the hip and knee joint replacements, the artificial shoulder joint has yet to offer a long-term satisfactory solution to shoulder replacement. With loosening being the number one reason for TSA revision, investigating methods of monitoring the glenoid implant loosening and investigate the effects of various design parameters on the loosening behaviour of the glenoid fixation is necessary to explore the problem. Several studies were carried out using in-vitro cyclic testing and FEA to; investigate failure progression and its correlation to quantitative measures in a 2D study (n = 60), investigating key glenoid design features in a 2D (n = 60) and 3D study (n = 20), investigating the validity of using bone substitute foam for studying glenoid fixation in a cadaveric study and investigating any correlation between failure and CT or in-vitro quantitative measures (n = 10). Visible failure was observed, for the first time, correlating to inferior rim displacement and vertical head displacement measures. CT failure was detected in 70% of specimens before visible failure was observed. Out of the design pairs tested; smooth-back/rough-back (range of roughnesses), peg/keel, curved-back/flat-back and conforming/non-conforming, roughening the back-surface to 3.4 μm or more improved fixation performance (p < 0.05). Roughening the back-surface changed the mode of failure from implant/cement failure inferiorly due to tensile/shear stresses, to cement/bone failure superiorly due to compressive/shear loading. Differences in the other design pairs were marked showing peg to perform better than keel, conforming over non-conforming and no difference in curved-back over flat-back, although these differences are marginal. Improvements in the standard testing method have also been suggested.

=520  3\$aThe central aim of this thesis is to better understand the dynamics of a set of dynamicallycoupled map systems previously introduced by Ito & Kaneko in a series of papers (Phys. Rev. Lett. 88 (2002), no. 2, 028701 and Phys. Rev. E 67 (2003), no. 4, 046226). The currentwork extends Ito & Kaneko?s studies to clarify the changes in macrodynamics inducedby the differences in microdynamics between the two systems. A third system is alsointroduced that has a minor change to the microdynamics from nonlinear to linear outputfunction in the externally coupled system. The dynamics of these three dynamically-coupled maps is also compared with theirsimplified systems with static coupling. The previous studies of these dynamically-coupledmaps showed a partitioning of the parameter space into regions of different macrodynamics. Here, an in-depth study is presented of the behaviour of the systems as they cross theboundary between one region and another. The behaviour across this boundary is shown tobe much more complicated than suggested in the previous studies. These three systems of dynamically-coupled maps all differ in the form of their microscopiccouplings, yet two of the systems are shown to produce similar macrodynamics,whereas the third differs dramatically by almost any measure of the macrodynamics. The time it takes for the systems to synchronise, both the dynamically-coupled andstatic-coupled systems, is investigated. It is shown that the introduction of dynamicalcouplingsstops the systems from synchronising quasi-instantaneously. Details of potentialconsequences of this in the field of neuroscience are discussed. A brief study of the effect of driving the systems with external stimuli is presented. The different microscopic coupling forms cause different responses to the external stimuli. Some of the responses are similar to that observed by the visual cortex area of the brain.

=520  3\$aProton conducting ceramics based on acceptor doped perovskites are the subject of investigationas candidate electrolyte materials for Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cells (SOECs). Specifically,BaCe0.9Y0.1O3-[delta](BCY10) and BaZr0.9Y0.1O3-[delta](BZY10) were investigated. Sampleswith greater than 95% of the maximum theoretical density were successfully prepared using aBCY10 commercial powder. It was found that when small additions of ZnO were added toa BZY10 commercial powder, a density of greater than 95% of the theoretical maximum wasachievable whereas without ZnO addition, the maximum achievable density was 85%. BCY10was found to have a total conductivity approximately one order of magnitude greater than ZndopedBZY10 over the entire temperature range studied. Spray pyrolysis and sol-gel methodswere used successfully to prepare single phase pure BZY10 powders. The sintering behavioursof the powders produced by spray pyrolysis were found to alter significantly with changes inpowder processing parameters. BCY10 and Zn-doped BZY10 cells were tested in electrolysisand fuel cell modes and the effects of varying operating conditions on cell performances werestudied. At 750oC, the Area Specific Resistances (ASR) of a BCY10 cell in electrolysis modewas found to be lower when the anode compartment was humidified to [approximately equal]83% than to[approximately equal]3%.Below this temperature, ASR values were greater when using increased humidity levels. It wasconcluded that a degree of oxide ion conduction may be beneficial to the operation of protonconducting electrolysers. Post-test, BCY10 cell cross-sections were imaged using scanning electronmicroscopy and analysed using Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy. Significanterosion of grain boundaries regions close the electrode-electrolyte interfaces was observed andEDX spectroscopy results suggested the formation of a secondary phase in these regions, possiblyY:CeO2. Had testing continued over an extended period of time it is probable that BCY10cells would have undergone mechanical failure.

=520  3\$aPromyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) are found within the nucleus ofmammalian cells. Numbering between 10 and 30 per nucleus, they are an obviousfeature of the nuclear landscape, yet their functions have still to be unambiguouslydefined. In the mammalian nucleus, compartmentalization of functions is apparent, asreflected in the wide-range of other nuclear compartments that can be identified. Quantification of relationships between PML NBs and other nuclear functionalcompartments is essential for a complete understanding of PML NB function. Initially,PML size, number, distance relationships, and spatial organisation in relation to eachother, and the nuclear boundary and centroid, under the spatial point pattern theoryhypothesis of Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR), were investigated in both normaland SV40 transformed MRC5 and WI38 human foetal lung fibroblasts. This was alsocompleted in normal MRC5 cells treated with heat shock, and interferon ? (both ofwhich alter PML NB morphometrics), and also serum starvation. PML NBs appeared tolocate according to CSR with respect to each other, and inter ? PML distances weredependent upon median PML NB number per nucleus. PML NBs did not tend toassociate with the nuclear centroid, and were repelled from the nuclear boundary in allcell lines and conditions. The distance and spatial organisation relationships betweenPML NBs and eleven different nuclear compartments were also compared andcontrasted in the cell lines and conditions mentioned previously. PML NBs were shownto share strong distance and spatial organisation relationships with the 11Simmunoproteasome regulator, SC35 domains,and transcriptional compartments innormal asynchronous nuclei, and with telomeres in transformed cells, highlighting likelyfunctions for the bodies. Lastly, the three dimensional spatial preference of functionalcompartments in the nucleus was determined using an aggregate map, which provided anovel means to visualise the nuclear location of functional compartments in relation toeach other, and under different cellular conditions. Spatial preference fell into fourcategories: 1) diffuse, 2) annular, 3) core, and 4) polar. Nucleoli and RNA polymerasemaintained their spatial preference across cell lines and conditions, whereas othercompartments showed altered spatial preferences. Interestingly, viral transformation ledto global disorganisation of the nucleus, where most compartments (including PMLNBs) reverted to a diffuse spatial preference.

=520  3\$aThis thesis presents a detailed study into the role of surface chemistry in the high sheargranulation of organic pharmaceutical solids. Crystalline materials with markedly differentsurface chemistries were selected as model compounds which were granulated with apolymeric binder. The surface wettability of primary powders was evaluated by employing the sessile dropcontact angle measurements to evaluate the facet-specific surface energetics ofmacroscopic crystals, obtained via a solvent-mediated or a temperature-controlledcrystallisation technique. A novel methodology using inverse gas chromatography (IGC) atfinite concentrations (FC) was developed to evaluate surface energy distributions of thepowder samples. The surface energetics of organic macroscopic crystals was found to be facet-specific,consistent with the local surface chemistry of the facet under examination. The rank orderof hydrophilicity of specific facet was in good agreement with concentration of hydroxylgroups determined from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. IGC-FC was applied tomeasure [gamma]d/SV profile, which were in good agreement with the [gamma]d/SV values measured fromcontact angle on the corresponding single crystals. This technique was shown to be able todistinguish surface energy heterogeneity, homogeneity as well as subtle changes in the [gamma]d/SV distributions, due to variations in the crystal habits. The wettability of the modelcompounds was ranked based on the contact angle polarity and IGC surface energyheterogeneity distributions, and the spreadability of binder solution was assessed based onthe thermodynamic spreading coefficients. The increase in surface wettability led to theincrease in granule mean size and granule strength. Formulations with similar wettingbehaviour resulted in similar granule size, whilst those formulations with dissimilar surfacewettability were found to exhibit substantially different granulation behaviour. In conclusion, the materials surface chemistry plays a crucial role in granulation processes. Its thorough characterisation and understanding may lead to more controllable productattributes and improved final performances.

=520  3\$aAggrecan is one of the most abundant components of the articular cartilage matrix and its degradation by aggrecanases is considered to be a key early event in the development of osteoarthritis. This study investigates whether the extracellular level of ADAMTS-4 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motifs-4), one of the most studied aggrecanases, can be regulated by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Exogenously-added ADAMTS-4 disappeared from the medium of HTB94 cells and TCA-soluble degradation products of ADAMTS-4 increased in the medium over time. Fluorescent-labeled ADAMTS-4 could be detected within the cell by confocal microscopy. ADAMTS-4 clearance by HTB94 cells and chondrocytes could be inhibited by more than 70 % by heparin and another sulfated glycan, calcium pentosan polysulfate, suggesting that the cellular uptake of ADAMTS-4 was via a mechanism involving cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). GM6001 also inhibited ADAMTS-4 clearance by 50 %, suggesting that cell surface metalloprotease-mediated degradation played a contributory role. However, ADAMTS-4 clearance was reduced by 50 % in a HSPG-deficient cell line compared to wild-type cells, further supporting a HSPG-dependent mechanism of ADAMTS-4 cellular uptake and preliminary studies using Timp-3-null fibroblasts suggest that ADAMTS-4 may be endocytosed in a complex with TIMP-3. In HTB94 cells and chondrocytes, the appearance of TCA-soluble degradation products was also inhibited by at least 50 % by receptor-associated protein (RAP), an antagonist for members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) family. However, siRNA knockdown of LDL-receptor-related protein (LRP-1), a member of the LDL-R family, in HTB94 cells and the use of an LRP-1-deficient cell line had no affect on the clearance of ADAMTS-4. These results suggest that another member of the LDL-R family may be involved. Taken together, this research has revealed a novel RAP-sensitive and/or HSPG-sensitive mechanism of ADAMTS-4 regulation which may have a role in the degradation of the cartilage matrix.

=520  3\$aWith the large resource densities available on modern FPGAs it is often the availablememory bandwidth that limits the parallelism (and therefore performance) that can beachieved. For this reason the focus of this thesis is the development of an integratedscheduling and memory optimisation methodology to allow high levels of parallelism to beexploited in FPGA based designs. A manual translation from C to hardware is first investigated as a case study,exposing a number of potential optimisation techniques that have not been exploited inexisting work. An existing outer loop pipelining approach, originally developed for VLIWprocessors, is extended and adapted for application to FPGAs. The outer loop pipeliningmethodology is first developed to use a fixed memory subsystem design and then extendedto automate the optimisation of the memory subsystem. This approach allocates arraysto physical memories and selects the set of data reuse structures to implement to matchthe available and required memory bandwidths as the pipelining search progresses. Thefinal extension to this work is to include the partitioning of data from a single array acrossmultiple physical memories, increasing the number of memory ports through which datamy be accessed. The facility for loop unrolling is also added to increase the potential forparallelism and exploit the additional bandwidth that partitioning can provide. We describe our approach based on formal methodologies and present the resultsachieved when these methods are applied to a number of benchmarks. These results showthe advantages of both extending pipelining to levels above the innermost loop and theco-optimisation of the datapath and memory subsystem.

=520  3\$aAbstractBiodiversity is disappearing at an exceptional rate, engendering a considerableeffort of the scientific community to conserve the rarest and most threatened species. Biodiversity Hotspots were designed for this purpose and Madagascar, showing thehighest levels of endemism and imbalance across taxa, rapidly became their flagship. The processes that lead to such exceptional biodiversity patterns on the island remainpoorly understood and the lack of efficacy of traditional taxonomy to cataloguetropical endemic biodiversity hinders the scientific advances in this domain. Thisstudy tackles insect endemism in Madagascar, aiming at identifying the evolutionaryand ecological factors responsible for their present diversity patterns. Aquatic beetles,living in standing or running water, submit to differences in habitat stability,potentially affecting dispersal patterns and hence endemism patterns. We chose themas a target group for these reasons, and first achieved a DNA level inventory of thefauna. We identified 169 species, showing high congruence with the morphologicaltaxonomy and corresponding to 74% of the total estimated species richness. Themitochondrial dataset revealed high spatial turnover at the species and haplotypelevels. A phylogenetic tree from three gene markers was used for ancestral statecharacter reconstruction and suggested the dependent evolution of endemism andhabitat use. Secondly, our results highlight a combination of low dispersal activityand important climatic constraints for the lotic fauna, explaining the local scaleendemism in this group, whereas the lentic species turnover correlated the least toboth climate and geographic distance. Last, a distribution modelling approachrevealed the uniqueness of Malagasy climate niches and the absence of conservationof environmental envelopes at higher phylogenetic levels. We conclude thatendemism in Madagascar is best explained locally by the dependence toenvironmental variability of the lotic species, and that dispersal capacities are theprimary hindrance to colonising external suitable habitats.

=520  3\$aGlucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a peptide hormone, secreted postprandially from enteroendocrine L-cells. GLP-2 has emerged as a central physiological mediator of intestinal growth and integrity and has recently shown promise as a therapeutic agent in patients with short bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. Reliable methods for GLP-2 measurement are not widely available. In this work a radioimmunoassay (RIA), using the GLP-2 antiserum (FT-17) has been optimised and validated. Cross-reactivity with GLP-2 precursors and degradation products was investigated using column chromatography. It is shown that accurate estimations of active GLP-2 secretion in response to a physiological stimulus can be made using this RIA. Plasma concentration of GLP-2 and other hormones, secreted from L-cells, were investigated in patients with short bowel syndrome (SBS), morbid obesity and in those following Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. It is shown that, contrary to current thinking, SBS patients with a retained colon can be GLP-2 deficient despite increased L-cell activity as indicated by raised levels of PYY. Differential regulation of peptide generation in L-cells, depending on the residual intestinal anatomy, is a possible explanation. Secretion of PYY and glucagon-like peptides may also differ in obesity. Despite a previously documented attenuated postprandial PYY response in obese compared with normal weight subjects, no difference in glucagon-like peptide secretion was found in a series of test meals. In obese patients undergoing RYGB, an exaggerated postprandial GLP-2 response was noted as early as 2 days following the procedure and persisted for at least 2 years. In diabetic patients this adaptive response was delayed. Enhancing endogenous GLP-2 secretion might serve as a therapeutic strategy for patients in whom intestinal mucosal regeneration is impaired. It is shown that bile acids and glutamine act as effective GLP-2 secretagogues in model L-cells and that diversion of bilio-pancreatic secretions to the distal ileum leads to increased plasma concentration of GLP-2 in rats.

=520  3\$aMultinuclear solid state MAS NMR (¹H and ³¹P), ³¹P CSA solid state NMR, ²H NMR and x-ray diffraction techniques have been used to compare the structureand properties of DPPC:Andro and DPPC:4β-hydroxycholesterol with that of the properties known of DPPC:Chol mixtures in excess water. The formation of the L₀ phase is known to occur with PC:Chol mixtures with sufficient concentrations of cholesterol. The formation and properties of the L₀ phase was looked at with the cholesterol derivatives Andro (lacking in the hydrocarbon tail present in cholesterol) and 4β-hydroxycholesterol (possessing an extra hydroxyl group adjacent to the one present at the headgroup region of cholesterol). The L₀ phase shows fluid-fluid immisibility when combined with the disordered Lα phase. It is this heterogeneity that is believed to be important in the formation of lipid rafts, which are thought to play a role in the function of living cells. Cholesterol desorption from DOPC model membranes was examined using methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which has a high affinity for cholesterol and facilitates the mechanism of cholesterol desorption from lipid membranes. By running a number of experiments, measuring cholesterol desorption from MLV's and LUV's a cholesterol flip-flop rate within DOPC model membranes was measured using ¹H solution state NMR. A number of methods were also attempted to synthesise an asymmetric DOPC:DPPC membrane. These included a split glass slides method and a modified version of an emulsion method as described by Pautot et al. Lipid asymmetry with respect to the split glass slides and emulsion methods was to be observed by NMR, where any cholesterol asymmetry formed via desorption by methyl-β-cyclodextrin was to be evaluated via the use of paramagnetic NMR experiments. However no asymmetry was observed in either experiment.

=520  3\$aOne of the goals of neuroscience is to understand how animals perceive sensory information. This thesis focuses on visual systems, to unravel how neuronal structuresprocess aspects of the visual environment. To characterise the receptive field of aneuron, we developed spike-triggered independent component analysis. Alongsidecharacterising the receptive field of a neuron, this method provides an insight intoits underlying network structure. When applied to recordings from the H1 neuron ofblowflies, it accurately recovered the sub-structure of the neuron. This sub-structurewas studied further by recording H1 s response to plaid stimuli. Based on the response,H1 can be classified as a component cell. We then fitted an anatomicallyinspired model to the response, and found the critical component to explain H1 sresponse to be a sigmoid non-linearity at output of elementary movement detectors. The simpler blowfly visual system can help us understand elementary sensory informationprocessing mechanisms. How does the more complex mammalian corteximplement these principles in its network? To study this, we used multi-electrodearrays to characterise the receptive field properties of neurons in the visual cortex ofanaesthetised mice. Based on these recordings, we estimated the cortical limits onthe performance of a visual task; the behavioural performance observed by Pruskyand Douglas (2004) is within these limits. Our recordings were carried out in anaesthetisedanimals. During anaesthesia, cortical UP states are considered "fragmentsof wakefulness" and from simultaneous whole-cell and extracellular recordings, wefound these states to be revealed in the phase of local field potentials. This findingwas used to develop a method of detecting cortical state based on extracellularrecordings, which allows us to explore information processing during different corticalstates. Across this thesis, we have developed, tested and applied methods that helpimprove our understanding of information processing in visual systems.

=520  3\$aIn this thesis, we review various popular pricing models in the interest-rate market. Among thesepricing models, we choose the LIBOR Market model (LMM) as the benchmark model. Based onmarket practice experience, we also develop a pricing model named the ?Market volatility model?.By pricing vanilla interest-rate options such as interest-rate caps and swaptions, we compare theperformance of our Market volatility model to that of the LMM. It is proved that the MarketVolatility model produce comparable results to the LMM, while its computing efficiency largelyexceeds that of the LMM.Following the recent rapid development in the commodity market, in particular the energy market,we attempt to extend the use of our proposed Market volatility model from the interest-rate marketto the energy market. We prove that the Market Volatility model is capable of pricing various energyderivative under the assumption of absence of the convenience yield. In addition, we propose a newtype of exotic energy derivative which has a flexible option structure. This energy derivative isnamed as the Flex-Asian spread options (FASO). We give examples of different option structureswithin the FASO framework and use the Market volatility model to generate option prices andgreeks for each structure. Although the Market volatility model can be used to price various energy derivatives based onoil/gas contracts, it is not compatible with the structure of one of the most advanced derivativesin the energy market, the storage option. We modify the existing pricing model for storage optionsand use our own 3D-binomial tree approach to price gas storage contracts. By doing these, weimprove the performance of the traditional storage model.

=520  3\$aSol-gel derived bioactive glasses with the 70S30C composition (70 mol% SiO2 and 30mol% CaO) have high potential as materials for bone regeneration and devices forsustained drug delivery. They bond to bone and have a unique tailorable nanoporosity,which affects protein adsorption and cellular response. The first aim of this thesis is tofully characterise the evolution of the nanoporous structure of sol-gel derivedbioactive glass for the first time, to fully understand its nanostructure evolution andcontrol. Nanoparticles that were produced early in the sol-gel process, agglomeratedinto larger particles during gelation and during thermal stabilisation. Calcium wasfound to not enter the silica network until the material was heated to 400 ?C. This hasimplications for the homogeneity of the calcium distribution in sol-gel derivedbioactive glasses. Region separation was found within sol-gel derived bioactive glass monolithsproduced by the standard procedure. The calcium concentration and nanoporositywere found to be higher near the edge of the monoliths. This is believed to be causedby calcium accumulation on the outer surface of the monoliths during the drying stageof the sol-gel process. The homogeneity of monoliths was successfully improved byusing Teflon moulds. To provide further control of the nanostructure of 70S30C, amethod for increasing the nanopore diameter from 12 nm to 30 nm was devised byadding specific amount of trimethylethoxysilane (TMES) during the sol-gel process. A series of amounts of TMES were added at different time points during the sol-gelprocess. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron microscopy wereused to explore the mechanisms behind the changes in nanostructure. Protein adsorption to sol-gel glass was investigated using in situ studies bymonitoring the adsorption of fluorescent-labelled proteins onto various types of solgelderived bioactive glasses under confocal microscope with fibrinogen as modelprotein. Fibrinogen molecules were found to penetrate into inner nanopores ofTheraGlass? (a commercial glass with 17 nm nanopores) whereas no penetration wasfound into sol-gel derived silica (with 3 nm nanopores). Protein interactions werefurther studied by conducting bioactivity tests with SBF supplemented with 10%serum. Apatite deposition was found inhibited by the interference of serum proteins.

=520  3\$aEndocrine Disrupting Chemicals (EDCs) are a diverse array of natural and man-made substances capable of interfering with hormonally mediated processes. They are particularly harmful to cells that are differentiating and dividing rapidly, can stimulate unwanted cell growth, and can interfere with normal epigenetic imprinting causing changes that in some instances are heritable. Due to their epigenetic effects and effects on tissue growth and development, organisms at certain life stages are more vulnerable than others and effects may manifest a long time after exposure. The risks posed to human and environmental health by these compounds are currently unknown, but there is a growing scientific consensus that precautionary measures and further research to understand and quantify these risks are needed. Endocrine Disrupting pesticides represent a subset of EDC capable of reaching humans from a diverse range of sources via many different exposure routes. No definitive lists or screening methodologies exist to identify them. In the UK, exposure routes involving occupational pesticide use for agricultural purposes or the residues of these pesticides in food and water are well quantified but other sources of exposure are not. If risk management measures are to be enacted to protect the population, these exposures will have to be quantified and the risks they pose assessed. This project aims to identify the hazards posed by ED pesticides to humans living in the UK, prepare a framework for the assessment and management of risks they pose, identify the tasks that remain to be completed before such a framework could be implemented, and to investigate poorly documented ED pesticide exposure sources. Current toxicological testing of pesticides was found to be inadequate. Properties frequently exhibited by EDCs, such as non-monotonic (j-type) dose responses and the additive and synergistic actions of compounds were not taken into account. Only active ingredients are legally required to be tested even although adjuvants used to improve formulation effectiveness are not always inert and formulations can be more toxic or have greater ED potential than their active ingredients alone. Adjuvants are assessed on a reactive basis, which is not adequate to protect public health. A tiered risk assessment and management framework capable of screening potential ED pesticides and making recommendations for risk management can be created using existing deterministic and probabilistic models of human pesticide exposure. The identification of critical groups that are more vulnerable than the general population to the effects of EDCs allows risk assessment and management to be tailored to protect these groups, allowing the risk to both these groups and the general population to be minimised, in keeping with the precautionary principle. Further work is required, however, to collect appropriate datasets to model non agricultural exposure routes and model the exposure of rural residents and bystanders. Assumptions made in the creation of foreign models would need to be checked to ensure they were compatible with UK conditions. Appropriate ADIs for EDCs showing non-monotonic dose responses would also need to be determined, and exposure profile differences between people living in urban, peri-urban and rural environments would also have to be taken into account. A number of ED pesticides used for medicinal, veterinary and domestic purposes and the municipal and commercial maintenance of infrastructure and recreational areas were identified. Unfortunately little could be determined about the factors influencing their use by the public. The number of years spent in secondary education correlated positively with non ED medicinal pesticide use and both ED and non ED veterinary and domestic use. It was unclear why this should be. Golf courses were the most heavily treated publicly accessible areas studied and used the most ED pesticides. Large parks received least, with pesticide use concentrated on hard surfaces and high maintenance ornamental areas. Pesticide use in parks is dominated by herbicides. Applications to pavements and other publicly accessible hard surfaces consisted almost entirely of glyphosate based herbicides. Herbicide applications on pavements and in parks mostly take place in the spring and early summer. The bulk of pesticide applications on golf courses were applied in the autumn. Contractors carrying out maintenance work for local authorities were found to use more pesticides than local authority employees. Non chemical methods of ectoparasite, pest and weed prevention and control have the potential to reduce pesticide use. Some of the methods currently in use, however, were found to be more costly and challenging to implement than chemical methods. The integration of these into parasite, pest and weed prevention and control strategies where possible and their further development should be encouraged.

=520  3\$aAccurate thermal analysis of axial flux permanent magnet (AFPM) machines is crucial inpredicting maximum power output, and a number of heat transfer paths exist making itdifficult to undertake a general analysis. Stator convective heat transfer is one of the mostimportant and least investigated heat transfer mechanisms and therefore is the focus of thepresent work. Experimental measurements were undertaken using a thin-film electrical heating methodbased on a printed circuit board heater array, providing radially resolved steady state heattransfer data from an experimental rotor-stator system designed as a geometric mockup of athrough-flow ventilated AFPM machine. Using a flat rotor, local Nusselt numbers Nu(r) = hR/k were measured across 0.6<r/R< 1,as a function of non-dimensional gap ratio 0.0106 < G < 0.0467 and rotational Reynoldsnumber 3.7e4 < Re [Theta]1e6 where G = g/R and Re [Theta] = [omega]R2/[Nu]. Averaged results Nu werecorrelated with a power law and it was found that Nu [is approximately equal to] ARe0.7 [Theta] in the fully turbulent regime(Re [Theta] > 3e5), with A being a function of G. In the laminar regime, stator Nu was foundto be similar to that of the free rotor. Transition at the stator occurred at Re [Theta] = 3e5 forall G and is particularly marked at G < 0.02. Increased Nusselt numbers at the peripherywere always observed because of the ingress of ambient air along the stator due to therotor pumping effect. A slotted rotor was also tested, and was found to improve stator heattransfer compared with a flat rotor. The measurements were compared with computational fluid dynamics simulations. Thesewere found to give a conservative estimate of heat transfer, with inaccuracies near the edge(r/R > 0.85) and in the transitional flow regime. Predicted stator heat transfer was found tobe relatively insensitive to the choice of turbulence model and the two-equation SST modelwas used for most of the simulations.

=520  3\$aTo achieve continued performance improvements, modern microprocessor design is tending to concentratean increasing proportion of hardware on computation units with less automatic managementof data movement and extraction of parallelism. As a result, architectures increasingly include multiplecomputation cores and complicated, software-managed memory hierarchies. Compilers havedifficulty characterizing the behaviour of a kernel in a general enough manner to enable automaticgeneration of efficient code in any but the most straightforward of cases. We propose the concept of indexed dependence metadata to improve application development andmapping onto such architectures. The metadata represent both the iteration space of a kernel and themapping of that iteration space from a given index to the set of data elements that iteration mightuse: thus the dependence metadata is indexed by the kernel?s iteration space. This explicit mappingallows the compiler or runtime to optimise the program more efficiently, and improves the programstructure for the developer. We argue that this form of explicit interface specification reduces the needfor premature, architecture-specific optimisation. It improves program portability, supports intercomponentoptimisation and enables generation of efficient data movement code. We offer the following contributions: an introduction to the concept of indexed dependence metadataas a generalisation of stream programming, a demonstration of its advantages in a componentprogramming system, the decoupled access/execute model for C++ programs, and how indexed dependencemetadata might be used to improve the programming model for GPU-based designs. Ourexperimental results with prototype implementations show that indexed dependence metadata supportsautomatic synthesis of double-buffered data movement for the Cell processor and enables aggressiveloop fusion optimisations in image processing, linear algebra and multigrid application casestudies.

=520  3\$aVaccinia virus (VACV) encodes multiple proteins which modulate NF-κB activation to evade the host immune response. One example is B14, a virulence factor that reduces NF-κB activation via interaction with IKKβ. B14 has orthologues in many VACV strains, including modified virus Ankara (MVA), which lacks many of the immunomodulators present in other VACV strains. Here, the MVA counterpart of B14, protein 183, was characterised. 183R was both removed from MVA and inserted into the B14R locus of a VACV strain Western Reserve (WR) lacking B14R, but in each case there was no change of phenotype. Protein 183 shares 95% amino acid identity with B14 but, unlike B14, was unstable in eukaryotic cells, unless protein degradation was inhibited. Protein 183 did not inhibit NF-κB activation in response to cytokine stimulation, as does B14, nor did it restore the virulence phenotype of WR lacking B14R back to wild type. Therefore, the mutations incurred by 183 during the derivation of MVA have rendered the protein non-functional. However, other MVA immunomodulators remain to be characterised and this thesis describes a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system that may facilitate the improvement of MVA in its role as a vaccine vector. To further characterise VACV modulation of NF-κB, a VACV WR strain was constructed lacking B14 and another VACV modulator of NF-κB, WR A49. Initial characterisation showed no change with this mutant virus in replication or spread. The effect of the B14 on NF-κB was further characterised by studying the B14-IKKβ interaction using IKKβ and B14 mutants. Residues 300 to 480 of IKKβ were shown to be required for the interaction and a mutant encompassing this region co-purified to a degree with B14 when expressed in E. coli. In addition, mutagenesis showed that B14 residue F130 is required for the interaction of the two proteins.

=520  3\$aArtificial Intelligence research has producedmany effective techniques for solving a wide rangeof problems. Practitioners tend to concentrate their efforts in one particular problem solvingparadigm and, in the main, AI research describes new methods for solving particular types ofproblems or improvements in existing approaches. By contrast, much less research has consideredhow to fruitfully combine different problem solving techniques. Numerous studies havedemonstrated how a combination of reasoning approaches can improve the effectiveness of one ofthose methods. Others have demonstrated how, by using several different reasoning techniques,a system or method can be developed to accomplish a novel task, that none of the individualtechniques could perform. Combined reasoning systems, i.e., systems which apply disparatereasoning techniques in concert, can be more than the sum of their parts. In addition, theygain leverage from advances in the individual methods they encompass. However, the benefitsof combined reasoning systems are not easily accessible, and systems have been hand-craftedto very specific tasks in certain domains. This approach means those systems often suffer froma lack of clarity of design and are inflexible to extension. In order for the field of combined reasoningto advance, we need to determine best practice and identify effective general approaches. By developing useful frameworks, we can empower researchers to explore the potential of combinedreasoning, and AI in general. We present here a framework for developing combinedreasoning systems, based upon Baars? Global Workspace Theory. The architecture describes acollection of processes, embodying individual reasoning techniques, which communicate via aglobal workspace. We present, also, a software toolkit which allows users to implement systemsaccording to the framework. We describe how, despite the restrictions of the framework, wehave used it to create systems to perform a number of combined reasoning tasks. As wellas being as effective as previous implementations, the simplicity of the underlying frameworkmeans they are structured in a straightforward and comprehensible manner. It also makes thesystems easy to extend to new capabilities, which we demonstrate in a number of case studies. Furthermore, the framework and toolkit we describe allow developers to harness the parallelnature of the underlying theory by enabling them to readily convert their implementations intodistributed systems. We have experimented with the framework in a number of application domainsand, through these applications, we have contributed to constraint satisfaction problemsolving and automated theory formation.

=520  3\$aDroplet-based microfluidic systems have recently been developed to overcome the problemsof slow mixing and dispersion associated with traditional microfluidic systems. By utilisingflow instabilities between two immiscible phases, droplets can be generated using normalmicrofluidic formats. Further, aqueous solutions can be confined and mixed within droplets,resulting in rapid homogenisation and no dispersion. Accordingly, droplet-based microfluidicsystems have been utilised in various applications in a high-throughput manner. However, thetechniques and methods for droplet formation, manipulation and detection have beencontinuously studied and improved upon to develop, prepare, manipulate and implementdroplet systems for real-world applications. Since droplets can be controllably produced withvariable reagent compositions at high generation frequencies (1 kHz or above), on-linedetection and characterisation of every high-speed droplet is one of the most importantchallenges associated with droplet analysis. The ability to extract information from eachdroplet microreactor is crucial for applications in high-throughput analysis and screening. Anappropriate detection technique able to extract the vast amount of information produced insuch systems is key in unlocking the full capabilities of droplet-based. In this work, a custom built confocal spectroscopic system was coupled with a droplet-basedmicrofluidic system to conduct high-sensitivity and high-throughput biological experiments. The integration of a confocal system allows for online characterisation of individual dropletsin terms of their size, formation frequency, fluorescence intensity and population. Thecombination of a droplet-based microfluidic system and the confocal detection setup has beensuccessfully used to demonstrate a few high-throughput chemical and biological applications. For example, the droplet system was utilised to demonstrate high-throughput single cellencapsulation, characterisation and quantification for the first time. In addition, highthroughputbinding assays and kinetic measurements using a well-known streptavidin-biotinbinding model and a protein-protein interaction were performed. Furthermore, a novelapproach for fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) was developed and used to analysemixing patterns within droplets. Specifically, data from FLIM measurements were extractedto determine spatially localised fluorescence lifetimes within droplets and thus a twodimensionalmap of droplet mixing. Finally, the droplet-based microfluidic approach wasexploited to perform biological analysis at the single molecule level.

=520  3\$aAsthma is the most common disease of childhood in the westernised world, affecting one child in seven in the United Kingdom alone. It is a complex disease involving both genetic and environmental factors. The financial burden for sufferers approximates £1 billion per annum in the UK and 80% of the sum is attributable to the patients with the severe, 'difficult/therapy-resistant' form of the disease. Previously, a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) for childhood asthma identified a number of loci significantly associated to the disease. The top ten SNP hits with the highest association (0.0001>P>0.00001) were chosen for an investigation of their importance in cases of severe asthma, both childhood and adult. The 10 SNPs were genotyped in 397 adults and 94 children using TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays. Genotyping data was analysed for genetic associations to the severe asthma phenotype using chi-squared tests. Control data was obtained from data generated in the original GWAS for the British controls. SNP rs6585018 located in the PDCD4 gene predicted promoter was found to be significantly associated to childhood asthma (P=3.4x10-7). Additional markers on the PDCD4 gene area were chosen to be typed in 116 severe asthmatic children and 145 healthy children from the UK. SNPs rs6585018 (P=0.005), rs1322997 (P=0.005) in the predicted promoter area and rs34104444 (P=0.01) in exon 5 were associated to severe asthma. The three SNPs were also correlated with PDCD4 transcript levels. PDCD4 genomic area was analysed in silico and ElectroMobility Shift Assay (EMSA) experiments were designed for the rs6548018 alleles to examine how they alter transcription factor binding sites. SNP rs6585018 was found to alter the binding site of the Myb transcription factor possibly altering the expression of PDCD4 gene. This study has provided insights into the genetic factors that are involved in disease aetiology of severe asthma.

=520  3\$aThis thesis is a history of the Polish Country Section of the Special Operations Executive (SOE), a British organisation whose purpose was to infiltrate agents behind enemy lines during World War II. The thesis covers the period 1940 ? 1946, the entire period that SOE existed, and its close connection with the Polish special department, formally known as the Sixth Bureau of the Polish Government in Exile. Chapters contained herein each cover a full year of operations from 1941 -1943, followed by two chapters for 1944, and one chapter for 1945-1946. Covered are details of agent training, information on the first flight to Poland to drop agents and couriers and the problems encountered. The German invasion of the Soviet Union and SOE?s thoughts on the predicted outcome is covered, as are also Polish operations in France and indications of support for Polish operations in other parts of the world. Throughout, is evidence of the difficulties in obtaining sufficient air support for flights to Poland which, although inadequate for Polish requirements, were more abundant than many realised at the time. This is especially true with reference to supplies dropped to Warsaw during the rising of 1944. Brief accounts of the meetings between the ?Big Three?, Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin, at Teheran and Yalta in as much as they affected SOE/Polish relations. The thesis finishes with appendices detailing agent/courier parachute drops, lists of personnel involved, a bibliography and glossary.

=520  3\$aOn-chip communication system has emerged as a prominently important subject in Very-Large-Scale-Integration (VLSI) design, as the trend of technology scaling favours logics more than interconnects. Interconnects often dictates the system performance, and, therefore, research for newmethodologies and system architectures that deliver high-performance communication servicesacross the chip is mandatory. The interconnect challenge is exacerbated in Field-ProgrammableGate Array (FPGA), as a type of ASIC where the hardware can be programmed post-fabrication. Communication across an FPGA will be deteriorating as a result of interconnect scaling. The programmablefabrics, switches and the specific routing architecture also introduce additional latencyand bandwidth degradation further hindering intra-chip communication performance. Past research efforts mainly focused on optimizing logic elements and functional units in FPGAs. Communication with programmable interconnect received little attention and is inadequately understood. This thesis is among the first to research on-chip communication systems that are built ontop of programmable fabrics and proposes methodologies to maximize the interconnect throughputperformance. There are three major contributions in this thesis: (i) an analysis of on-chipinterconnect fringing, which degrades the bandwidth of communication channels due to routingcongestions in reconfigurable architectures; (ii) a new analogue wave signalling scheme that significantlyimproves the interconnect throughput by exploiting the fundamental electrical characteristicsof the reconfigurable interconnect structures. This new scheme can potentially mitigatethe interconnect scaling challenges. (iii) a novel Dynamic Programming (DP)-network to provideadaptive routing in network-on-chip (NoC) systems. The DP-network architecture performs runtimeoptimization for route planning and dynamic routing which, effectively utilizes the in-siliconbandwidth. This thesis explores a new horizon in reconfigurable system design, in which newmethodologies and concepts are proposed to enhance the on-FPGA communication throughputperformance that is of vital importance in new technology processes.

=520  3\$aCohesin tethers sister chromatids together from their creation during S-phase until their separation at the metaphase to anaphase transition. Cohesion is essential for correct segregation and therefore genomic stability. Cohesin is also involved in the regulation of transcription and in DNA repair. Cohesin affects these processes by its ability to hold two pieces of DNA together. Cohesin is subject to a variety of post-translational modifications. In this study, the modification of cohesin, more specifically the Scc1 subunit, by Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) was analysed. It was found that cohesin is sumoylated during an unperturbed cell cycle, but is hyper-modified after DNA damage. To determine the function of Scc1 modification by SUMO, attempts were made to identify the modified residues. Mass spectrometry techniques for SUMO site identification were developed in parallel to site-directed mutagenesis studies. Potential sumoylation sites were identified on Scc1, but when these were mutated there was little effect on either viability or the sumoylation pattern obtained. Mutants were then constructed in which only one lysine was present. Surprisingly, several of these were viable, not sensitive to methyl methane sulfonate and were not sumoylated, suggesting that either sumoylation of Scc1 is not essential and not required after DNA damage, or that sumoylation of the rest of the cohesin complex can compensate. To investigate this, Scc1 fusions with the SUMO E2 ligase, Ubc9, and a SUMO isopeptidase, Ulp1, to mimic constitutively sumoylated and unsumoylatable cohesin respectively, were constructed. Unexpectedly, it was found that both fusions relocalized to a double strand break, and that the Ulp1 fusion was recruited to a greater extent. Data from our laboratory suggests that the Ubc9 fusion is not competent for cohesion after damage, although it is sufficient for viability. Sumoylation may therefore be involved in cohesin unloading or turnover, which might be required after DNA damage.

=520  3\$aA number of forms of coherent multi-dimensional vibrational spectroscopy(CMDVS) have been identified as being useful for addressing a range of biologicalproblems. Here a particular member of this family of spectroscopies, electronvibration-vibration two-dimensional infrared (EVV 2DIR) spectroscopy (alsoknown as DOubly-Vibrationally Enhanced InfraRed (DOVE-IR)), is explored for itspossible utility for two particular bioanalytical applications; protein identificationand the study of enzyme mechanisms. The main focus of this work is on thedevelopment of EVV 2DIR as a tool for high-throughput, label-free proteomics, inparticular for protein identification and absolute quantification. The proteinfingerprinting strategy is based on the identification of proteins through theirspectroscopically determined amino acid compositions. To this end, spectralsignatures of amino acid side chains (tyrosine, phenylalanine and tryptophan) havebeen identified, as well as those from CH2 and CH3 groups which have been foundto be appropriate for use as internal references. The intensities of these cross peaksare measured to give proteins? amino acid compositions in the form of amino acid /CHx ratios. Specialised databases comprising the amino acid / CHx ratios of proteinshave been developed for achieving protein identifications using the EVV 2DIR data. The second strand of this research considers the potential of triply resonant EVV2DIR for studying protein structures and mechanisms. It is possible to use theelectronic polarising properties of EVV 2DIR to good effect to achieve significantenhancement of the signal size when probing a chromophore. Here this effect isdemonstrated for the case of bacteriorhodopsin (bR) membranes isolated fromHalobacterium salinarium. The signal enhancement that is achievable from theretinal chromophore at the heart of bR makes it possible to study this whilstavoiding the surrounding protein.

=520  3\$aThe phage shock protein (Psp) response is found in many Gram-negative enterobacteria, where it helps to maintain the proton motive force (PMF) when the integrity of the inner membrane (IM) is impaired and promotes virulence of pathogens such as Yersinia or Salmonella. In Escherichia coli, Psp comprises seven genes (pspF pspABCDE and pspG) which are organised in a regulon under the control of two Sigma54-dependent promoters. Despite considerable advances, neither the mechanism of Psp induction nor the functioning of the Psp response is fully understood. Recent findings comparing the roles of ArcB in Yersinia enterocolitica and E. coli caused a dispute over the requirement of the two component system ArcAB in Psp signal-transduction. The present study now establishes that ArcAB involvement is conditional and appears to be mediated via protein-protein interactions between ArcB and PspB. The study further suggests that the cellular ubiquinone pool, which acts upstream of ArcAB, may also play a role in Psp signalling whereas dissipation of proton motive force (PMF), generally inferred to be the inducing signal, is not sufficient to mount a Psp response. To gain further insight into its functioning, PspA (a negative regulator and effector of Psp) and PspG (an effector of Psp) were visualised in vivo using fusions to Green fluorescent protein (GFP). To maintain PMF, PspA was proposed to uniformly cover the cytoplasmic face of the IM. However, the present study demonstrates that PspA (and PspG) is highly organised into distinct complexes at the cell pole and the lateral cell membrane. Real-time observations revealed lateral PspA and PspG complexes are highly mobile, but absent in cells lacking MreB. Without the MreB cytoskeleton, induction of the Psp response is still observed, yet these cells fail to maintain PMF under stress conditions.

=520  3\$aWe present a methodology for generating floating-point arithmetic hardwaredesigns which are, for suitable applications, much reduced in size, while stillretaining performance and IEEE-754 compliance. Our system uses threekey parts: a profiling tool, a set of customisable floating-point units and aselection of system integration methods. We use a profiling tool for floating-point behaviour to identify arithmeticoperations where fundamental elements of IEEE-754 floating-point may becompromised, without generating erroneous results in the common case. In the uncommon case, we use simple detection logic to determine whenoperands lie outside the range of capabilities of the optimised hardware. Out-of-range operations are handled by a separate, fully capable, floatingpointimplementation, either on-chip or by returning calculations to a hostprocessor. We present methods of system integration to achieve this errorcorrection. Thus the system suffers no compromise in IEEE-754 compliance,even when the synthesised hardware would generate erroneous results. In particular, we identify from input operands the shift amounts requiredfor input operand alignment and post-operation normalisation. For operationswhere these are small, we synthesise hardware with reduced-sizebarrel-shifters. We also propose optimisations to take advantage of otherprofile-exposed behaviours, including removing the hardware required toswap operands in a floating-point adder or subtractor, and reducing theexponent range to fit observed values. We present profiling results for a range of applications, including a selectionof computational science programs, Spec FP 95 benchmarks and theFFMPEG media processing tool, indicating which would be amenable toour method. Selected applications which demonstrate potential for optimisationare then taken through to a hardware implementation. We show upto a 45% decrease in hardware size for a floating-point datapath, with acorrectable error-rate of less then 3%, even with non-profiled datasets.

=520  3\$aLow power electronic circuits are required to extend the operationaltime of battery operated devices. They are also necessaryto reduce the power consumption of equipment in general, especiallyas the world tries to cut energy usage. The first sectionof this thesis explores fundamental and implementation limits forlow power circuits. The energy requirements of amplification arepresented and a lower bound on the energy required to transmitinformation over a point to point link is proposed. It is evident from the low power limits survey that when a transistoris biased, significant thermodynamic energy is required toreduce the resistance of the channel. A transmitter is presentedthat turns on a transistor for 0.1 % of transmitted time. Thistransmitter approximates a Gaussian pulse by allowing the impulseresponse of two 2nd order transmitting elements to sum infree space. The transmitter is of low complexity and the receiverarchitecture ensures that no on-line tuning is required. Measuredresults indicate that by using coherent detection a 1 Mbps, 50mm distance link with a bit error rate of 10?3 can be achieved. The bandwidth of the transmitted pulse is 30-37.5 MHz and 30dB of out of band attenuation is provided. An analogue Gabor transform is described which splits a signalinto parallel paths of a lower bandwidth. This enables post processingat lower clock rates, which can reduce energy dissipation. An implementation of the transform using sub-threshold CMOScontinuous time filters is presented. A novel method for designinglow power gmC filters using simple models of identical transconductorsis used to specify transistor sizes. Measured results showthat the transform consumes 7 ?W for an input signal bandwidthof 4 kHz.

=520  3\$aIn this research project we investigated the feasibility of incorporating organic solvent nanofiltration techniques with peptide synthesis and developed the Membrane Enhanced Peptide Synthesis process - the MEPS process. Two membranes had been identified to be applicable for the MEPS process to separate the peptide building block from post reaction waste. These are the commercially available Inopor ZrO2/Al2O3 hydrophobic membrane and the cross-linked polyimide membrane that had been fabricated in our laboratory. Two penta-peptides were synthesized on a soluble polymeric support to demonstrate the principle of MEPS process. The purity and yields of these penta-peptides were excellent when compared with one synthesized using the Liquid Phase Peptide Synthesis (LPPS) and Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (SPPS) processes. To improve the quality and supply of membrane for the MEPS process a number of membrane fabrication parameters were investigated. This investigation demonstrated ways of manipulating the performance of the cross-linked polyimide membrane which gives engineers the opportunity to tailor make polymeric membrane to meet the requirement of the MEPS process. This membrane optimisation provides the MEPS process with a constant supply of reproducible membrane and allows this process to be further developed into a highly repeatable process. Other soluble polymeric support products were also investigated in an attempt to avoid product contamination by PEGylated waste. Peptide chains were built onto a degradable polymeric support and once the desired peptide sequence had completed, the polymeric support was then completely hydrolysed in acid to obtain a high purity peptide product. Results showed this simple idea was not as straight forward to perform as expected. It demonstrated that the idea was possible and has great potential but further development is required. A number of recommendations have been suggested for further improvement and optimisation of this newly developed MEPS process. Not only are these related to the enhancement of the membrane stability, improvement in peptide crude purity and product yield, but also other potential applications of the MEPS principle.

=520  3\$aMicro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) have become ubiquitous in recent years andare found in a wide range of consumer products. At present, MEMS technology forradio-frequency (RF) applications is maturing steadily, and significant improvementshave been demonstrated over solid-state components. A wide range of RF MEMS varactors have been fabricated in the last fifteen years. Despite demonstrating tuning ranges and quality factors that far surpass solid-statevaractors, certain challenges remain. Firstly, it is difficult to scale up capacitancevalues while preserving a small device footprint. Secondly, many highly-tunable MEMSvaractors include complex designs or process flows. In this dissertation, a new micromachined zipping variable capacitor suitable forapplication at 0.1 to 5 GHz is reported. The varactor features a tapered cantilever thatzips incrementally onto a dielectric surface when actuated electrostatically by a pulldownelectrode. Shaping the cantilever using a width function allows stable actuationand continuous capacitance tuning. Compared to existing MEMS varactors, this devicehas a simple design that can be implemented using a straightforward process flow. Inaddition, the zipping varactor is particularly suited for incorporating a highpermittivitydielectric, allowing the capacitance values and tuning range to be scaledup. This is important for portable consumer electronics where a small device footprintis attractive. Three different modelling approaches have been developed for zipping varactordesign. A repeatable fabrication process has also been developed for varactors with asilicon dioxide dielectric. In proof-of-concept devices, the highest continuous tuningrange is 400% (24 to 121 fF) and the measured quality factors are 123 and 69 (0.1 and0.7 pF capacitance, respectively) at 2 GHz. The varactors have a compact design andfit within an area of 500 by 100 ?m.

=520  3\$aThe discovery of neutrino mass through experimental evidence of neutrino oscillationsat the end of the last century has provided the first proof that the StandardModel of particle physics is incomplete. To be able to extend the StandardModel to incorporate massive neutrinos first requires many theoretical uncertaintiessurrounding the particle and its interactions to be understood. Therefore, adedicated experimental programme is needed over the coming decades to provideprecision measurements of the neutrino oscillation parameters and also a possiblemeasurement of CP violation in the lepton sector, which could have astrophysicalconsequences. An intense source of neutrinos is required to achieve these precision measurementsand the leading contender proposed to provide this neutrino beam, is the NeutrinoFactory. Before a Neutrino Factory facility can be realised, a number of technologicalchallenges need to be evaluated and understood first. One of which, is reduce thelarge phase space volume (emittance) of the initial muon beam, which is eventuallystored and through decay provides the neutrino beam. Ionisation cooling is thechosen method to achieve this and the Muon Ionisation Cooling Experiment (MICE)at Rutherford Laboratory in the UK, is required to demonstrate ionisation coolingand its feasibility for a Neutrino Factory. To demonstrate ionisation cooling, a section of a cooling channel will be constructedand single-particle measurements of emittance of a muon beam before and after thecooling channel from particle spectrometers will be compared. To measure emittanceaccurately requires precision measurements of the momenta and spatial coordinatesat the spectrometers by tracking devices in a uniform magnetic field. The focusof this thesis is based around the construction and testing of the MICE tracker(s),including a study of its simulated performance and also construction and testing of a prototype.

=520  3\$aThe high-level goal of this research is to identify a method to accelerate generalpurpose software using heterogeneous systems. Heterogeneous systems offer thepotential of improving performance through the use of hardware componentsspecialised for a particular task. The issue considered in this research is how bestto map parts of an existing piece of software to components in a heterogeneousarchitecture to deliver the optimal program execution time. The heterogeneous partitioning problem is an NP-hard quadratic optimisationproblem. However, before the problem could be addressed using optimisationtechniques, the problem had to be quantified and formalised using software characterisationand computational abstraction models. The main contributions delivered by this research are:? 3S: a novel software characterisation framework that combines static instrumentationwith dynamic characterisation enabling simple tools to measurereal fine-grained execution timing, control and data flow information forany compilable program.? MAP: a new execution model and multi-level parallel assignment approachthat delivers up to 64 times the heterogeneous acceleration potential ofprevious work for the benchmarks considered.? MIP: the first formal work on multiple instantiation under activation sequenceuncertainty, providing more than twice the acceleration potentialof previous optimal assignment methods for the software considered andcapable of being integrated with MAP to deliver significant gains for heterogeneouspartitioning. These contributions have been published in a collection of research papers andare the focus of Chapters 3, 4 and 5 of this thesis.

=520  3\$aGlottal-synchronous speech processing is a field of speech science where the pseudo-periodicity of voiced speech is exploited. Traditionally, speech processing involves segmenting and processing short speech frames of predefined length; this may fail to exploit the inherent periodic structure of voiced speech which glottal-synchronous speech frames have the potential to harness. Glottal-synchronous frames are often derived from the glottal closure instants (GCIs) and glottal opening instants (GOIs). The SIGMA algorithm was developed for the detection of GCIs and GOIs from the Electroglottograph signal with a measured accuracy of up to 99.59%. For GCI and GOI detection from speech signals, the YAGA algorithm provides a measured accuracy of up to 99.84%. Multichannel speech-based approaches are shown to be more robust to reverberation than single-channel algorithms. The GCIs are applied to real-world applications including speech de-reverberation, where SNR is improved by up to 5 dB, and to prosodic manipulation where the importance of voicing detection in glottal-synchronous algorithms is demonstrated by subjective testing. The GCIs are further exploited in a new area of data-driven speech modelling, providing new insights into speech production and a set of tools to aid deployment into real-world applications. The technique is shown to be applicable in areas of speech coding, identification and artificial bandwidth extension of telephone speech.

=520  3\$a(?)-euonyminol is a poly-oxygenated sesquiterpene which was first isolated in 1953 byBeroza. It was isolated by the saponification of a mixture of four alkaloids fromTripterygium wilfordii Hook, a member of the Celastraceae plant family. Since itsdiscovery, (?)-euonyminol has been found to be a common core for a plethora of otherCelastraceae natural products. Among these are hypogluanine B and triptonine B, twopotent anti-HIV compounds. In this thesis, an overview of the natural products of the Celastraceae is given,highlighting euonyminol as a core of high value both in terms of biological activity andas an intriguing synthetic target. The biological significance of the natural product class isdescribed with particular focus upon anti-HIV and multi-drug resistance reversalproperties. Prior synthetic work towards euonyminol and other molecules similar instructure is also described. The remainder of the thesis describes work carried out towards the total asymmetricsynthesis of (?)-euonyminol, employing a model system to develop chemistry suitable forinstalling the southern hemisphere oxygenation pattern. Two synthetic routes aredescribed and both of these feature an Ireland-Claisen rearrangement as the key step.

=520  3\$aTransforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) is implicated in inflammation and airway wall remodeling in inflammatory airway disease. Oxidative stress has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disorders. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), in the airway may activate intracellular signalling cascades and transcription factors to exaggerate lung inflammation. The balance between nuclear histone acetylation/deacetylation has also been shown to be altered by oxidative stress and may further upregulate lung inflammation. The aim of this thesis was to determine whether ROS, alone or in combination with interleukin (IL)-1β can modulate TGF-β1 expression in lung epithelial cells and whether the effect was regulated by histone methylation. Stimulation of human airway epithelial cells (A549) with H₂O₂ or H₂O₂ plus IL-1β enhanced TGF-β1 mRNA and total protein expression. IL-1β and H₂O₂ together showed a greater than additive effect on TGF-β1 mRNA transcription, but not on the total protein level. The NF-[kappa]B-IKK2 inhibitor AS602868 suppressed IL-1β-and H₂O₂ plus IL-1β -induced TGF-β1 mRNA expression. NF-[Kappa]B p65 protein was also shown to be upregulated by IL-1β plus H₂O₂ stimulation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments demonstrated that p65 was recruited to the [Kappa]B3 binding site on the native TGF-β1 promoter area. The upregulation of TGF-β1 mRNA by IL-β plus H₂O₂ could be suppressed by fluticasone propionate (FP) although to the same extent as seen with IL-1β-stimulated TGF-β1 mRNA expression. This suggests that H₂O₂ induced a relative steroid insensitivity. Both Suv39H1 protein level and mRNA expression were downregulated by IL-1β and H₂O₂ stimulation. Knockdown of Suv39H1 with siRNA transfection induced a trend towards increased TGF-β1 mRNA expression upon stimulation with IL-1β and H₂O₂. Suv39H1 was shown to be recruited to glucocorticoid receptor by co-immunoprecipitation. The anti-inflammatory effect of FP was impaired under Suv39H1 knockdown which indicate that Suv39H1 may act as a corepressor of GR function. DNA methylation is also involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. IL-1β and H₂O₂ stimulation rapidly upregulated CpG methylation at specific sites in the TGF-β1 promoter as demonstrated by direct sequencing after bisulphite treatment and by methylation-dependent immunoprecipitation study (MeDIP). Methylation at the ATG start induced by IL-1β was reversed over time indicating an active demethylation. These results indicate that H₂O₂, acting via the NF-[Kappa]B pathway, increases TGF-β1 mRNA production and that this is regulated by FP possibly through an effect on the histone methyltransferase, Suv39H1. DNA methylation is also involved in the regulation of IL-1β plus H₂O₂ induced TGF-β1 mRNA expression.

=520  3\$aIn 2003 India launched a National Mission on Biofuels. Its main strategy has been to promote Jatropha curcas; a perennial shrub that bears non-edible oil seeds that can be used to produce biodiesel with the aim of achieving a target of 20% blending of biodiesel by 2012. This thesis recommends a framework that will enable people to implement Biodiesel Production System in Karnataka State, India, and possibility replicate it in other developing countries. Detailed combinations of Life Cycle Assessment with Technical and Cost-benefit Analysis have been developed to assess the suitability of individual oilseed crops for large scale cultivation from energy, environmental and socio-economic perspectives. The ways in which biodiesel are produced with the impacts on energy balance, GHG emissions and costs have been evaluated. All large scale agricultural and small-scale agricultural scenarios produced negative NPV per life cycle. A key common feature from all the results is that in conditions of an established market, the price of Jatropha oilseeds, as a final product of agricultural enterprise, has a strong influence on price of Jatropha SVO, the main raw material for biodiesel production. As such, it will require strong and direct government?s intervention to both agricultural and industrial phases of this chain, to keep them in business. For large scale agricultural scenarios demonstrate the following options to make NPV of the feedstock production positive: a) raise Jatropha oilseed price in 1.91-2.08 times, b) impose government?s subsidies on working capital at least 41.55-69.85% large, or c) impose government?s subsidies on CAPEX at least 27.25-28.81% large. For small-scale agricultural scenarios sensitivity analysis produces the following options: a) to raise Jatropha oilseed price in 1.92-2.38 times, or b) to impose government?s subsidies on working capital at least 41.5-51.0% large. The results of this work do not show a way in which subsidies could be removed. In deciding whether to support this technology, the public support for early stage commercialization investment might be considered as illustrated in the ?Stern Review: The Economics of Climate Change? (2006) by experience curves. For all large scale and small-scale agricultural scenarios, the correlation results demonstrate that price of oilseeds, the Jatropha oilseed yields, the labour cost coefficient, and subsidies on working capital (Private Capital) are all significantly correlated with NPV and NPV/GHG avoided ratio. For both large scale and small-scale production scenarios, only the price of Jatropha oil significantly correlated with NPV and NPV/GHG avoided ratio. Cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrates a very high GHG avoided (GBP/tCO2eq) costs for all scenarios compared to the current market price of Certified Emissions Reduction (CER). To make average costs of GHG avoided comparable with current CER price, the price of Jatropha oilseeds should be reduced by 0.91-1.99 times in Irrigated and by 1.22-1.91 times for Rainfed scenarios. However, in this case, the effect on economics of Jatropha oilseeds cultivation (agricultural scenarios) will be disastrous. To show the potential savings, the energy use and GHG emissions for each Model have been compared with the Well-to-Tank (WTT) energy and GHG emissions for diesel (basic scenario). Some Models actually save more fossil energy than is contained in the produced biodiesel as a result of the large energy savings attached to electricity production and other by-products utilization. The GHG savings has a pattern which is clearly corresponding with the energy one. The emissions from farming, especially excessive N2O emissions, are responsible for significant fraction of total GHG emissions. All Rainfed scenarios demonstrate much better energy and GHG emissions performance than Irrigated scenarios. Unfortunately, considerable benefits of energy and GHG savings produced by small-scale in comparison to large-scale Jatropha cultivation have been challenged by the negative results of the Cost-benefit analysis for the same Models.

=520  3\$aIntroduction: This thesis aims to characterize the biology of solid and liquid phase coronary thromboaspirate obtained during therapeutic aspiration at primary angioplasty for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Methods: We studied coronary thromboaspirate obtained from the coronary artery (CA) in STEMI and focussed on three lines of investigation: (i) Intracoronary solid phase thrombus was subjected to immunohistochemistry for characterization and quantification of the different leukocyte types and proteins involved in the thrombus. (ii) Resident cell populations in the liquid phase filtrate from the aspirate including platelets and leukocytes along with their subpopulations were analysed by flow cytometry for phenotypic and activation markers. Comparison was made with cells in the peripheral femoral artery (FA) blood. (iii) Paired plasma/serum from the CA filtrate and FA blood were analysed for the presence of autoreactive antibodies and cytotoxic potential. Results: (i) Leukocytes were heterogeneously distributed in the ex-vivo thrombus. The granulocyte population was predominant and strongly expressed CD11b and vimentin. (ii) The CA aspirate filtrate when compared to the paired FA blood contained significantly more leukocyte-platelet conjugates, more activated platelets, and more Vimentin. (iii) More of the CD⁴⁺ T cells in the CA than FA had lost the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 (p<0.00001) and they often expressed effector phenotype marker. (iv) Conversely, the immune-regulatory T cells expressing the FoxP3 were more attenuated in the CA than FA (p<0.00001). (v) Whilst IgG and IgM antivimentin antibody titres in the CA sera were consistently lower than the titres in FA sera (p<0.001), auto-reactive non-HLA IgM were more prevalent in CA sera. The CA sera had increased potential to induce apoptosis than FA sera when incubated with endothelial cells (p<0.001). Conclusions: (i) Aspirated intracoronary clot contained granulocytes as the predominant leukocyte component. This investigation of the immune system in the CA during AMI therefore moved on to the adaptive system in the coronary filtrate. (ii) Increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory immune cells and reduced concentrations of immune-modulating cells were observed in the aspirate from the culprit site of CA occlusion when compared with the FA. The presence of T memory cells implies that this subset may have been released from the ruptured coronary plaque and this phenotypic analysis may help clarify the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of coronary plaque instability. (iii) The higher titres of auto-reactive IGM in the CA than FA sera have the potential to activate the complement system and may contribute to myocardial injury following therapeutic restoration of coronary flow in STEMI.

=520  3\$aThe increasing demand for organs has stimulated the necessity in xenotransplantion, which promises an unlimited supply of organs for clinical use. However, coagulopathy of xenografts remains a major hurdle to successful pig-to-primate xenotransplantation. The ability to generate pigs expressing a human complement-regulatory protein (hCRP) and/or pigs in which the α1,3-Galactosyltransferase gene has been knocked-out (GT-KO) has largely overcome the barrier of hyperacute rejection (HAR) of a pig organ transplanted into a primate. However, acute humoral xenograft rejection (AHXR), presenting as microvascular thrombosis with/without consumptive coagulopathy (CC), ensures and results in graft failure. The causes of coagulopathy were believed to be humoral response-dependent. Xenoreactive antibodies (Abs) and activation of complement provoke porcine endothelial cells (ECs) from an anticoagulant to a procoagulant phenotype. In this study, I demonstrated that recipient platelets and monocytes were activated to express tissue factor (TF), an initiator of the coagulation cascade, after incubation with porcine ECs through humoral immune response-independent process. These observations were mirrored in the animal studies. Kidneys or livers from GT-KO pigs that express a hCRP transplanted into non-human primates were not susceptible to HAR. Nevertheless, most recipients developed CC, even when the grafts were still functioning. Activation of graft ECs and the measurable immune response were minimal. TF expression on recipient platelets plays a pivotal role in initiating CC. Therefore, understanding the interactions between porcine ECs and primate platelets may be crucial to prevent coagulopathy. On the other hand, the generation of GT-KO pigs has directed interest to the role of anti-nonGal Abs in intravascular thrombosis. My study revealed that anti-nonGal Abs activated porcine ECs to express TF, independent of complement activation. I also demonstrated that anti-P-selectin and vWF Abs and some anti-platelet agents, such as clopidogrel and eptifibatide, prevented TF expression on platelets after incubation with porcine ECs. Porcine ECs from pigs that expressed tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) were resistant to the activation induced by primate serum even with high titre anti-nonGal Abs. Atorvastatin not only inhibited this activation of platelets but also prevented the activation of porcine ECs induced by primate serum. Coagulopathy is increasingly recognized as barriers to successful xenotransplantation, many mechanisms of which are not associated with humoral immune response. Further manipulation of the immune response alone, with the risk of inducing infection and other complications, does not appear likely to resolve the challenge of xenograft coagulopathy. My results provide evidence for further genetic manipulation or systemic pharmaceutical treatment to prevent coagupolpathy seen after pig-primate xenotransplantation.

=520  3\$aMicroneme proteins (MICs) belong to a protein family that is actively involved in theinvasion of host cells by apicomplexan parasites. Among these proteins, MIC2 is amember of the Thrombospondin-related anonymous (TRAP) family of adhesiveproteins, which are highly conserved within the apicomplexans. The othermicroneme protein M2AP, known to facilitate the transport of MIC2 through thesecretory network, is also essential to the virulence of the parasite. Most importantly,MIC2 and M2AP form a multimeric functional complex that presents in the cellinvasive stages and serves as the prototype of other TRAP family members. This thesis describes the NMR assignments and two solution structure calculations ofM2AP and a Thrombospondin type-1 repeats (TSR-1) domain. M2AP is composedexclusively of beta strands and, despite no sequence similarity, demonstrates clearstructural similarity to the galectin-like domain from MIC1. And TSR-1 repeats fromMIC2 demonstrate two typical TSR-like-fold domains. Interactional studies revealthat the M2AP binds both the first and the last pair of TSR-1 repeats of MIC2. Theresults on structure?function relationship of MIC2 and M2AP reinforce the criticalrole of TRAP protein in the successful invasion of cells by T. gondii and revealpotential therapeutic targets that may be used to control toxoplasmosis.

=520  3\$aSince the 1980s, small additions of rhenium have been found to markedlyimprove the creep properties of nickel based superalloys. However, the underlyingcauses for this effect are not yet fully understood. In this work, avariety of experimental and modelling techniques have been used to evaluatepossible mechanisms improving creep properties at high temperature. Ab initio modelling (via the Density Functional Theory) has shown thatrhenium clusters are unstable in the nickel lattice. This observation wasconfirmed by Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure, which showedthat rhenium atoms are dispersed in the nickel lattice. Atom Probe Tomographyalso found no clusters in Ni-Re alloys and in CMSX-4, a commercialsingle-crystal superalloy. Atom Probe Tomography, in conjunction with Phase Field Modelling, wasalso used to show that the rhenium enrichment close to the [gamma]/[GAMMA] interfacesis formed upon cooling from service temperature. Thus means that therhenium enrichment observed with the atom probe does not play a role inthe strengthening effect played by rhenium. Finally, ab initio modelling(via the Density Functional Theory) was used to investigate the effect ofrhenium on the stacking fault energy of nickel to ascertain whether rheniumcontent could increase the spacing between Shockley partial dislocations. The present work shows that rhenium clustering, the rhenium enrichmentclose to the [gamma]/[GAMMA] interfaces and the rhenium effect on stacking fault energycannot be the mechanisms underlying the rhenium-effect in nickel basedsuperalloys. It therefore appears that single atoms of rhenium may slowdown dislocation motion in the [gamma] phase of nickel based superalloys. This issupported by the observation that rhenium is the slowest diffusing elementin nickel and it is therefore expected to slow down all diffusion activatedprocesses, such as the well-established climb-assisted glide of dislocationsin the [gamma] phase of nickel based superalloys.

=520  3\$aExpression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are generated by the combined use of microarray technology to measure gene expression and genetic linkage analysis to map the expression traits to the genome. This thesis describes co-expression and quantitative trait transcript (QTT) analysis carried out on a dataset consisting of thousands of cis- and trans-eQTLs. These were mapped in 29 rat Recombinant Inbred strains derived from a cross between the Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR), a widely used model of the human metabolic syndrome, and the normotensive Brown Norway (BN). Gene expression data from four tissues relevant to the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease were analysed: fat, kidney, adrenal gland and left ventricle. By systematically applying a rigorous statistical methodology to the eQTL dataset, a consistent, distinct correlation structure was observed. Co-expression of groups of transcripts linked to a common region of the genome, referred to as trans-eQTL clusters, was investigated. Some of these cluster-forming groups were found to remain significantly correlated after the effect of genotype was accounted for, and functionally enriched. An example of successful application of QTT analysis to the dataset is described. This contributed to the identification of Ogn as a regulator of left ventricular mass in rodents and subsequent implication of the homologue of Ogn in a related role in humans. Correlation of a further 103 physiological traits with cis-eQTLs in each of the four tissues was also carried out; analysis which potentially informs a wide range of hypotheses concerning relevant phenotypes. Together, the findings described here demonstrate the utility of a systematic computational approach using correlation-based methodologies in combination with appropriate statistical techniques to inform the genetic analysis of complex traits. These findings indicate the importance of understanding potential confounding factors in eQTL analysis, as well as the potential of the eQTL approach to stimulate gene discovery.

=520  3\$aThe cell nucleus houses a wide variety of macromolecular substructures includingthe cell?s genetic material. The spatial configuration of these substructures isthought to be fundamentally associated with nuclear function, yet the architecturalorganisation of the cell nucleus is only poorly understood. Advances in microscopyand associated fluorescence techniques have provided a wealth of nuclear imagedata. Such images offer the opportunity for both visualising nuclear substructuresand quantitative investigation of the spatial configuration of these objects. In thisthesis, we present new tools to study and explore the subtle principles behind nucleararchitecture. We describe a novel method to segment fluorescent microscopy images of nuclearobjects. The effectiveness of this segmentation algorithm is demonstrated usingextensive simulation. Additionally, we show that the method performs as well asmanual-thresholding, which is considered the gold standard. Next, randomisationbasedtests from spatial point pattern analysis are employed to inspect spatial interactionsof nuclear substructures. The results suggest new and interesting spatialrelationships in the nucleus. However, this approach probes only relative nuclearorganisation and cannot readily yield a description of absolute spatial preference,which may be a key component of nuclear architecture. To address this problem we have developed methodology based on techniquesemployed in statistical shape analysis and image registration. The approach proposesthat the nuclear boundary can be used to align nuclei from replicate imagesinto a common coordinate system. Each nucleus and its contents can therefore beregistered to the sample mean shape using rigid and non-rigid deformations. Thisaggregated data allows inference regarding global nuclear spatial organisation. Forexample, the kernel smoothed intensity function is computed to return an estimateof the intensity function of the registered nuclear object. Simulation provides evidencethat the registration procedure is sensible and the results accurate. Finally, we have investigated a large database of nuclear substructures usingconventional methodology as well as our new tools. We have identified novel spatialrelationships between nuclear objects that offer significant clues to their function. We have also examined the absolute spatial configuration of these substructuresin registered data. The results reveal dramatic underlying spatial preferences andpresent new and clear insights into nuclear architecture.

=520  3\$aPolymer-small molecule blend films are of increasing interest in the field of organic solarcells. This thesis employs transient absorption spectroscopy as a mean to study chargephotogeneration in these blend films. These studies allow identifying and addressing thecharge photogeneration efficiency-limiting processes in polymer:perylene diimide organicsolar cells. We approach the question by considering the influence of nanomorphology and phasesegregation on charge photogeneration and recombination dynamics. We further report onyield of charge separated species in polythiophene / perylene diimide blend films as afunction of electron acceptor?s energy levels. We find that, compared to polythiophene /PCBM blend films, charge photogeneration is significantly enhanced. Correlations betweenfree energy for charge dissociation and charge photogeneration yield within differentpolymer:acceptor series are observed and indicate the generality of this relationship. Furthermore, the energetic model proposed to account for these results is consistent with thewell-established Onsager and Marcus theories. It can therefore be concluded that the yield ofphotogenerated charges in polymer/acceptor systems is likely to be dependent upon theexcess vibrational energy of the bound radical pair, such that the key kinetic competition inthe photogeneration process is between vibrational relaxation and dissociation of this speciesSimultaneously, we investigate photoinduced charge separation in solid films of two perylenediimides and a donor-bridge-acceptor (D-B-A)molecule, exTTF-pcp-C60 relative to solution. First we find Intramolecular charge separation and recombination is correlated with areduction in the yield of long-lived, intermolecular charge-separated species in the perylenediimide dyad. In the D-B-A system we observe the exTTF-pcp-C60 motif in this case leads tomore charges than the reference compounds or a mixture of them but that the excited state ofthe electron acceptor, the fullerene, suffers from concentration self-quenching which severelyaffect the charge yield in solid films.

=520  3\$aJanus kinases (JAKs) and Signal Transducer and Activators of Transcription(STATs) are essential for signalling in response to the Interferons (IFNs) and mostcytokines. Aberrant activation of JAKs and/or STATs has been observed in many humancancer cells, and several recent studies have suggested that STAT3 oncogenic pathwaysare also associated with intrinsic drug resistance. Chemoresistance is a major cause of failure of cancer treatment. In lung cancercells chemoresistance can be mediated by Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF-2). In small celllung cancer (SCLC) cell lines FGF-2 induces the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins via aMEK-ERK-dependent mechanism, which involves the formation of a multi-proteincomplex constituted by B-RAF, PKC? and S6K2. We investigated the generality of thisphenomenon by analysing additional types of cells. Since there have been reportssuggesting that activation of JAKs and/or STATs can occur downstream of FGF-2 wehypothesised that JAKs and/or STATs may also play a role in FGF-2 mediatedchemoresistance pathway(s).In U2OS osteosarcoma cells, FGF-2 offers protection against cisplatin-induced celldeath. As with SCLC cells this involves B-RAF, PKC?, S6K2, MAPKs and, most notably,JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, or TYK2), but not the STATs. Whereas the non-small lung cancer cells(NSCLC) HCC95 respond to FGF-2, HCC78 do not. In neither case, however, did FGF-2mediate chemoresistance against cisplatin. Using RNA interference (RNAi), we have observed that ERK2 knockdown causeda concomitant reduction of STAT3 levels. The data suggest that ERK2, but not ERK1,levels can regulate STAT3 expression, and that ERK1 and ERK2 have non-overlappingfunctions. It also indicates that ERK2 protein levels can regulate STAT3, an importantsignal transducer and activator of transcription. The identification of a novel inter-play between the JAKs and MAPKs in thecontext of chemoresistance opens new avenues for treatment, which urgently warrantadditional studies.

=520  3\$aThis thesis introduces novel wavelet-based semi-parametric centralized and distributedcompression methods for a class of piecewise smooth functions. Our proposed compression schemes are based on a non-conventional transform coding structure with simpleindependent encoders and a complex joint decoder. Current centralized state-of-the-art compression schemes are based on the conventional structure where an encoder is relatively complex and nonlinear. In addition, thesetting usually allows the encoder to observe the entire source. Recently, there has beenan increasing need for compression schemes where the encoder is lower in complexityand, instead, the decoder has to handle more computationally intensive tasks. Furthermore, the setup may involve multiple encoders, where each one can only partiallyobserve the source. Such scenario is often referred to as distributed source coding. In the first part, we focus on the dual situation of the centralized compression wherethe encoder is linear and the decoder is nonlinear. Our analysis is centered around aclass of 1-D piecewise smooth functions. We show that, by incorporating parametricestimation into the decoding procedure, it is possible to achieve the same distortion-rate performance as that of a conventional wavelet-based compression scheme. We alsopresent a new constructive approach to parametric estimation based on the samplingresults of signals with finite rate of innovation. The second part of the thesis focuses on the distributed compression scenario, whereeach independent encoder partially observes the 1-D piecewise smooth function. Wepropose a new wavelet-based distributed compression scheme that uses parametric estimation to perform joint decoding. Our distortion-rate analysis shows that it is possiblefor the proposed scheme to achieve that same compression performance as that of ajoint encoding scheme. Lastly, we apply the proposed theoretical framework in the context of distributedimage and video compression. We start by considering a simplified model of the videosignal and show that we can achieve distortion-rate performance close to that of a jointencoding scheme. We then present practical compression schemes for real world signals. Our simulations confirm the improvement in performance over classical schemes, bothin terms of the PSNR and the visual quality.

=520  3\$aCurrent therapy for PD is focused on dopamine replacement by the use of L-DOPA anddopamine agonists, which relieve the Parkinsonian motor symptoms led by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra par compacta (SNc). However, the long-term use of these agents could induce side effects and fail to slow down the progression of the nigral dopaminergic neuronal loss. Thus, there is an increasing demand for neuroprotective agents that can relieve the symptoms and alter the dopaminergic neuronal death in PD. Excitotoxicity, due to the excessive glutamate release from subthalamic nucleus (STN) to the SNc, could jeopardize the neurodegeneration in the SNc. Thus, the modulation of the glutamate could prevent the cellular loss in PD SNc. Accordingly, the selective ligands acting on metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) were proved to be anti-Parkinsonian in PD models. Furthermore, the group III mGluR agonist, L-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid(L-AP4), was proved to be neuroprotective in the 6-OHDA PD model. In this study, therefore, the subtypes of group III mGluRs, such as mGluR4, 6, 7 and 8, was examined in order to provide a more specific neuroprotection. Thus, N-phenyl-7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamide (PHCCC) and(S)-3,4-dicarboxyphenylglycine ((S)-DCPG) were utilized for the activation of mGluR4 and 8 respectively which are expressed prevalently in basal ganglia. Herein, the concentration-dependent and receptor mediated neuroprotection of PHCCC and(S)-DCPG against 6-OHDA toxicity in rodent model of PD were demonstrated. Furthermore, PHCCC and (S)-DCPG are neuroprotective when administered to animals systemically. Moreover, the neuroprotective potential of PHCCC and (S)-DCPG were putatively demonstrated in another PD model of lactacystin, an ubiquitin-proteasome inhibitor. In this study, we also reported the effect of PHCCC and (S)-DCPG on the glial cells involved in the PD models, elucidating the underlying neuroprotective mechanism of these ligands. Thus, mGluR4 and 8 may be a promising therapeutic target for further pharmacological development.

=520  3\$aFollowing a large loss of coolant accident in a PWR, cooling is performed bysuperheated vapour with entrained droplets, which bounce from the hot metal withoutwetting it. This thesis describes experimental and modelling studies aimed at theevaluation of the direct cooling by these droplets. Droplet diameters are less than2 mm, they spend ~15 ms near the surface, extract ~1/5 J, cooling the metal by ~50 oCwith heat fluxes of the order of MW/m2. An interface-tracking CFD code was used tomodel the droplet approach, the generation of vapour from its underside and itsrebound or break-up, and to compute the transient cooling of the hot metal below thedroplet. Validation of this model requires measurements of the heat transfer. A novelmethod to measure the transient surface temperature beneath the droplet is reported,using transient high resolution infra-red spectroscopy. Spatial and temporalresolutions of ~100.?m and ~4ms respectively are achieved, observing an opaquemetallic layer from beneath through an infrared-transparent substrate. Post-processingvia transient finite elements permits all thermal quantities (heat flux, energy, etc) to bedetermined. Associated simultaneous high speed optical recording of the dropletmotion and deformation provided data for validation of the hydrodynamic aspect ofthe prediction. It is estimated that these methods allow the heat extracted by (forexample) a 1.5 mm droplet during the 10 ms it spends in the vicinity of the hot surfaceto be obtained with an uncertainty of 15%. This heat extracted is approximately0.19 J, associated with a transient temperature reduction of ~47 oC, and is removed bya heat flux peaking at 3.5 MW/m2. Encouraging agreement was obtained betweenthese measurements and the computational simulations. For this same case, the CFDanalyses predict 0.12 J and a peak heat flux of 5 MW/m2.

=520  3\$aThis thesis is devoted to reducing the interactive latency of image processing computations invisual effects. Film and television graphic artists depend upon low-latency feedback to receivea visual response to changes in effect parameters. We tackle latency with a domain-specific optimisingcompiler which leverages high-level program metadata to guide key computational andmemory hierarchy optimisations. This metadata encodes static and dynamic information aboutdata dependence and patterns of memory access in the algorithms constituting a visual effect ?features that are typically difficult to extract through program analysis ? and presents it to thecompiler in an explicit form. By using domain-specific information as a substitute for programanalysis, our compiler is able to target a set of complex source-level optimisations that a vendorcompiler does not attempt, before passing the optimised source to the vendor compiler forlower-level optimisation. Three key metadata-supported optimisations are presented. The first is an adaptation ofspace and schedule optimisation ? based upon well-known compositions of the loop fusion andarray contraction transformations ? to the dynamic working sets and schedules of a runtimeparameterisedvisual effect. This adaptation sidesteps the costly solution of runtime code generationby specialising static parameters in an offline process and exploiting dynamic metadata toadapt the schedule and contracted working sets at runtime to user-tunable parameters. The secondoptimisation comprises a set of transformations to generate SIMD ISA-augmented source code. Our approach differs from autovectorisation by using static metadata to identify parallelism, inplace of data dependence analysis, and runtime metadata to tune the data layout to user-tunableparameters for optimal aligned memory access. The third optimisation comprises a related setof transformations to generate code for SIMT architectures, such as GPUs. Static dependencemetadata is exploited to guide large-scale parallelisation for tens of thousands of in-flight threads. Optimal use of the alignment-sensitive, explicitly managed memory hierarchy is achieved by identifyinginter-thread and intra-core data sharing opportunities in memory access metadata. A detailed performance analysis of these optimisations is presented for two industrially developedvisual effects. In our evaluation we demonstrate up to 8.1x speed-ups on Intel and AMDmulticore CPUs and up to 6.6x speed-ups on NVIDIA GPUs over our best hand-written implementationsof these two effects. Programmability is enhanced by automating the generation ofSIMD and SIMT implementations from a single programmer-managed scalar representation.

=520  3\$aThis thesis focuses on two important issues in turbulence theory of wall-boundedflows. One is the recent debate on the form of the mean velocity profile (is it alog-law or a power-law with very weak power exponent?) and on its scalings withReynolds number. In particular, this study relates the mean flow profile of theturbulent channel flow with the underlying topological structure of the fluctuatingvelocity field through the concept of critical points, a dynamical systems concept thatis a natural way to quantify the multiscale structure of turbulence. This connectiongives a new phenomenological picture of wall-bounded turbulence in terms of thetopology of the flow. This theory validated against existing data, indicates thatthe issue on the form of the mean velocity profile at the asymptotic limit of infiniteReynolds number could be resolved by understanding the scaling of turbulent kineticenergy with Reynolds number. The other major issue addressed here is on the fundamental mechanism(s) ofviscoelastic turbulence that lead to the polymer-induced turbulent drag reductionphenomenon and its dynamical aspects. A great challenge in this problem is the computationof viscoelastic turbulent flows, since the understanding of polymer physics isrestricted to mechanical models. An effective numerical method to solve the governingequation for polymers modelled as nonlinear springs, without using any artificialassumptions as usual, was implemented here for the first time on a three-dimensionalchannel flow geometry. The superiority of this algorithm is depicted on the results,which are much closer to experimental observations. This allowed a more detailedstudy of the polymer-turbulence dynamical interactions, which yields a clearer pictureon a mechanism that is governed by the polymer-turbulence energy transfers.

=520  3\$aLung cancer is the biggest cancer killer. Most patients present with advanced disease. These diseases are not amenable to surgery which currently provides the best chance of cure. New treatment approaches are urgently needed, and these will come from a greater understanding of the disease biology. Our group has identified growth factor signaling molecules, downstream of growth factor receptors, which are overexpressed in all SCLC tumours examined compared to lung epithelial cells. These include the growth controlling kinase the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Here the importance of mTOR in lung cancer was examined. We examined the expression of mTOR in NSCLC and SCLC patients. We demonstrated that total mTOR was overexpressed in early stage NSCLC patients and in SCLC patients. More specifically mTOR predicts poor outcome in early stage NSCLC patients. It appears to identify poor outcome in lymph node negative and stage IA patients where previously other markers have failed to consistently yield prognostic benefit. This information may help identify those at high risk of relapse. We demonstrate that using total protein immunohistochemistry may be more useful than using phospho-protein expression in assessing the contribution of a signaling protein to cancer biology in patient specimens. We show that in cell lines, formalin fixed cell line and in tumour biopsies phospho-mTOR signals varies in intensity with time from removing from media/blood supply. We suggest that no conclusions can be drawn from commonly used phospho-protein immunohistochemical studies and total protein studies may be more reliable. Previously our laboratory has shown that high concentrations of rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, block MEK/ERK signaling which is necessary for pro-survival/chemoresistance effects induced by FGF-2 in SCLC cells. We demonstrate that this phenomenon is also observed with the clinically relevant mTOR inhibitor- RAD001 and other growth factors/chemicals in other SCLC cell lines, but not in NSCLC cell lines. It is therefore possible that high concentrations of RAD001 might help to reduce FGF-2-induced chemoresistance in SCLC. Moreover, by impairing growth factor induced ERK signaling; RAD001 has an additional mechanism of blocking growth factor induced proliferation. This could be a potentially novel therapeutic method. We investigated the mechanism of how mTOR mediates the ability of high concentrations of rapalogues to suppress MEK/ERK signaling and FGF-2 triggered chemoresistance. Using siRNAi and a PP2A inhibitor to various components of the pathways involved, we have found that neither FKBP12 nor mTOR is directly involved whilst the phosphatase PP2A may aid the mTOR regulation of MEK/ERK signaling. We established, using combination analysis, that the H69 SCLC cell line is more sensitive to combined mTOR inhibitor/cytotoxic chemotherapy killing compared to the H510 SCLC cell line and the order of drug exposure may not be important. Collectively, our results show that mTOR is important in NSCLC as well as SCLC biology providing a possible biomarker for poor outcome and a suitable target for new therapies such as RAD001.

=520  3\$aInorganic nanoparticles and their accompanying diverse physical properties are now virtually inroutine use as imaging tools in cell-biology. In addition to serving as excellent contrast agents,their size- and environment-dependent optical and magnetic properties can be harnessed tocreate enzyme biosensor devices of extremely high sensitivity, whilst circumventing the numeroustechnical limitations associated with traditional enzyme assays. This thesis explores new applications of noble metal and semiconductor nanoparticles (quantumdots) for the detection of a range of medically-relevant enzymes. Here, water soluble colloidalgold nanoparticles and quantum dots are modified with peptides and antibodies to affordnew reagents for enzyme sensing. These bio-functionalised nanoparticle probes exhibit numerousadvantages over traditional enzyme sensing systems owing to their robust and size-tuneableoptical properties. These enzyme-responsive nanoparticle systems are tailored to detect the activity of proteinkinase and histone acetyltransferase activity in a simple homogeneous assay format based onF?rster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Furthermore, these systems can be applied to screenfor putative small-molecule modulators of enzyme function. These new assays should provide thebasis for the development of a variety of new enzyme detection strategies based on nanoparticlespecific optical phenomena.

=520  3\$aThe Antarctic Peninsula is larger than the UK and with limited geologicalmapping campaigns since the 1940s significant gaps in coverage remain, particularlyin areas where access is difficult. Remote sensing offers potentialfor improving geological mapping on the peninsula but has not been used forthese purposes. This thesis describes the use of Advanced Spaceborne ThermalEmission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data for lithological mapping ofpredominantly calc-alkaline subduction-related igneous rocks on the AntarcticPeninsula. The research encompassed lithological mapping of four study areasselected to provide an appropriate test of the potential of ASTER. Processingof ASTER reflectance and thermal emission data used spectral enhancementprocedures and the matched filter (MF) spectral mapping method. This wassupported by reflectance spectroscopy of rock samples, Hyperion data, thinsection petrography, geochemical data for acid volcanic rocks, and fieldworkon Adelaide Island. The research shows although outcrop is limited in thepolar context, weathering effects and vegetation cover do not cause significant problems. ASTER provides a range of lithologic information enablingvalidation of inferred field mapping and new observations of unmapped geologyin the study areas. Granitoids and silicic volcanic rocks display distinctivespectral properties and are newly identified from unmapped parts ofthe Oscar II, Foyn, and Lassiter coasts. Areas of localised alteration in theserocks are readily discriminated based on the distinctive absorption featuresof the alteration mineral assemblages. ASTER is less successful at discriminatingintermediate-mafic igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic lithologiesthat display more ambiguous spectral features. For these rocks lithologicalmapping is strongly reliant on existing field observations to resolve ambigiousresults. The research shows that although ASTER is limited in its ability touniquely discriminate different rock types it can provide important lithologicalinformation in support of geological mapping on the Antarctic Peninsula.

=520  3\$aWWOX is a tumour suppressor gene, as demonstrated by increased neoplasia incidence in Wwox-knock-out animals, and is frequently disrupted in human cancers. WWOX expression reconstitution abolishes xenograft growth of lung, pancreatic, breast, ovarian and prostate cancer cells. The tumour suppressive function of WWOX is suggested to be related to pro-apoptotic effects or interactions with potentially oncogenic transcription factors leading to their cytoplasmic sequestration and trans-activity inhibition. In physiology WWOX might be involved in metabolism. Our group demonstrated that WWOX reconstitution in ovarian cancer cells inhibits xenograft growth but this was not accompanied by altered in vitro growth or apoptosis rates. Rather, WWOX transfection reduced cancer cell adhesion to extracellular matrix due to reduction of integrin α3 binding. Additionally, our group postulated that natural polymorphic variants of WWOX are linked to ovarian cancer clinico-pathological features. The hypotheses behind this work were that WWOX regulates gene expression or promotes apoptosis in ovarian cancer. Further, this project aimed at confirming the associations of WWOX polymorphisms. I demonstrate no link between WWOX status and the subcellular localization of putative WWOX-binding transcription factors or the expression of their target genes in ovarian cancer cells. The phenotypic consequences of WWOX expression manipulation do not appear to be explained bytranscriptional changes. I show that WWOX increases apoptosis rates in ovarian cancer cells exposed to the chemotherapy agent paclitaxel, but not cisplatin. This is independent of the anti-mitotic function of taxanes and unrelated to integrin regulation. Rather, WWOX promotes cell death during taxane-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress. I propose WWOX-driven cell death during endoplasmic reticulum stress might be also linked to anti-tumorigenic effects in vivo. A validation study did not confirm the link between WWOX genetic variants and ovarian cancer pathology. There is also no link between WWOX polymorphisms and bone metabolism, a trait affected in WWOX-knock-out animals.

=520  3\$aThe research concerns improvement of the power efficiency of lubricated components in automotive drivelines such as transmissions and axles. Meshed gear pairs, rolling bearings, seals and oil churning by rotating components immersed in the oil are studied. The purpose of the research is to explore the most effective way of improving the efficiency in drivelines, focusing on an axle comprising hypoid gears and a differential assembly. First, a study of the nature of losses affecting the efficiency of a simple spur gear box was carried out, and a model of friction and churning in a simple transmission was developed. Next, a detailed experimental study of oil churning losses in a hypoid axle from a four wheel drive road vehicle was carried out using the inertia run-down technique. To perform the above experiments, a new test rig for measuring oil churning losses was designed, manufactured and commissioned. The test rig allowed a wide range of speed and lubricant parameters to be explored and was designed by the author for tests available at different roll and pitch attitudes. In addition, an "extended" housing, consisting of a modified gear case that accepted the same internal components as the production axle but which had much greater internal clearances, was designed and manufactured. This enabled the effects of different casing geometry and of internal baffles to be studied. Additionally, the extension housing was modified to investigate the oil flow inside the housing through its one transparent side for the understanding of the effect of oil flow on churning losses. An investigation of design-related parameters influencing churning losses was carried out using the new test rig. Empirical equations for the churning losses, based on dimensional analysis, were developed to describe the test results. It was found that some combinations of baffles gave a significant reduction in losses. Supplementary tests were carried out usingtransparent windows to visualise the oil flow. These identified some of the mechanisms responsible for the reduction in churning loss and suggested a number of practical methods by which churning could be reduced without compromising the lubricant supply to remote components. It is argued that these innovations can contribute to improving fuel efficiency and limiting oil temperature rise in all-wheel-drive vehicles.

=520  3\$aIntracellular ion concentration and cation transporter activities are important determinants of many fundamental physiological parameters, including cell turgor, plasma membrane potential and intracellular pH. In order to maintain these parameters within physiological ranges despite external perturbations, cells regulate their transporter activities through both post-translational modifications and gene regulation. In this thesis, the ion regulations in two model fungal species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus nidulans, are investigated. We use a mathematical modelling approach to gain a quantitative understanding of the impact of collective transporter activities on the intracellular cation concentrations and the cellular adaptation processes. This thesis is mainly composed of two parts: 1) A biophysical and mathematical model is built for the cation transporters and their regulatory proteins to describe the temporal changes of cell volume, intracellular pH and cation concentrations during hyper-osmotic stress, ionic stress and alkaline pH stress in S. cerevisiae. 2) Four models are built for the activation of the alkaline pH responsive transcription factor, PacC, in A. nidulans, based on competing hypotheses. The integrated model in the first part shows that calcineurin activation in response to stress conditions results in a rapid and transient decrease of membrane potential, which we speculate is an important strategy for the cell to respond to unknown external ionic perturbations. The model also confirms the importance of Hog1p phosphorylation on Nha1p and Tok1p for immediate adaptation to salt stress and predicted that activated Hog1p down-regulates Tok1p activity. In alkaline stress conditions, the induction of Ena1p expression results in increased membrane potential. This model provides a theoretical framework for the study of ion homeostasis in stress conditions, the understanding of drug effects, such as FK506. And since the membrane potential is an important determinant of drug uptake, themodel is well suited for the drug development. In the second part of the thesis, results from those competing models for PacC activation show significant difference for the pacC904 mutant strain and suggests that further experiments on this strain would be able to uncover the role of the intermediate form, PacC53, plays in the activation process.

=520  3\$aThis thesis presents work undertaken with cold rubidium atoms interacting with an opticalmicrocavity. The optical microcavity used is unique in its design, being formed between anoptical fibre and silicon micromirror. This allows direct optical access to the cavity mode,whilst the use of microfabrication techniques in the design means that elements of the systemare inherently scalable. In addition, the parameters of the system are such that a single atomhas a substantial impact on the cavity field. In this system, two types of signal arise from the atoms' interaction with the cavity field;a `reflection' signal and a `fluorescence' signal. A theoretical description for these signals ispresented, followed by experiments which characterise the signals under a variety of experimentalconditions. The thesis then explores two areas: the use of the microcavity signals foratom detection and the investigation of how higher atom numbers and, as a result, a largercooperative interaction between the atoms and the cavity field, impacts the signals. First, the use of these signals to detect an effective single atom and individual atoms whilstfalling and trapped is explored. The effectiveness of detection is parameterised in terms ofdetection confidence and signal to noise ratio, detection fidelity and dynamic range. In the second part of this thesis, the effect of higher atom numbers on the reflection and fluorescence signals is investigated. A method for increasing the atom number is presented,alongside experiments investigating the impact on the measured signals. This is followed byexperiments which explore the dispersive nature of the atom-cavity interaction by measuringthe excitation spectrum of the system in reflection and fluorescence. In doing so, it is shownthat, for weak coupling, these two signals are manifestly different.

=520  3\$aMiniaturized glucose-oxygen biofuel cells are useful to power implantablemedical devices such as biosensors. They are small, more biocompatible and runcontinuously on glucose and oxygen, providing cleaner energy at neutral environment. A typical glucose-oxygen biofuel cell consists of an anode with glucose oxidase (GOx)and a cathode with various oxygen reducing catalysts. This thesis describesexperimental investigations of the major issues of such systems, viz.: complex electrodefabrication, enzyme instability and inefficient oxygen reduction. Electrodes were builtusing the simple and scaleable bulk modification method, where all the material wassimply mixed and bound together into composites with epoxy resin. For the anodes, thecomposite made of 10% GOx with 7:7 TTF-TCNQ was found optimal. The GOxelectrodes were modified with various enzyme stabilisers (PEI, DTT, PEG, GLC, FADand mixture of PEI:DTT and PEI:FAD) and 2% of PEI-DTT (1:1 w/w) was mosteffective in the presence of O2. Its maximum output current density was 1.8 x 10-2 ? 9.9x 10-3 A.m-2. It also showed the resistant against O2 electron deprivation and enzymeinhibition. Its KM.was 5 mM. For the cathodes, various oxygen reducing catalysts(metalised carbon, anthroquinone modified carbon, laccase and bilirubin oxidase) wereincorporated into graphite composite and the electrodes were pretreated in differentmedia in order to enhance their catalytic activity. None showed four-electron O2reduction. NaOH-pretreated cobalt (II) salophen composite electrodes showedtwo-electron O2 reduction and were most catalytic. Its standard catalytic rate constantwas 1.2 x 10-5 ? 1.2 x 10-6 m.s-1. Of the catalysts examined, metal complex compositesgave the best results for oxygen-reducing cathodes and their pretreatment led to thesynergetic effect because it increased the concentration of catalytic surface oxygengroups and enhanced oxygen reduction.

=520  3\$aRAID systems are widely deployed, both as standalone storage solutions and asthe building blocks of modern virtualised storage platforms. An accurate model ofRAID system performance is therefore critical towards fulfilling quality of serviceconstraints for fast, reliable storage. This thesis presents techniques and tools that model response times in zonedRAID systems. The inputs to this analysis are a specified I/O request arrivalrate, an I/O request access profile, a given RAID configuration and physical diskparameters. The primary output of this analysis is an approximation to the cumulativedistribution function of I/O request response time. From this, it is straightforwardto calculate response time quantiles, as well as the mean, variance andhigher moments of I/O request response time. The model supports RAID levels0, 01, 10 and 5 and a variety of workload types. Our RAID model is developed in a bottom-up hierarchical fashion. We begin bymodelling each zoned disk drive in the array as a single M/G/1 queue. The servicetime is modelled as the sum of the random variables of seek time, rotationallatency and data transfer time. In doing so, we take into account the properties ofzoned disks. We then abstract a RAID system as a fork-join queueing network. This comprises several queues, each of which represents one disk drive in the array. We tailor our basic fork-join approximation to account for the I/O requestpatterns associated with particular request types and request sizes under differentRAID levels. We extend the RAID and disk models to support bulk arrivals, requestsof different sizes and scheduling algorithms that reorder queueing requeststo minimise disk head positioning time. Finally, we develop a corresponding simulationto improve and validate the model. To test the accuracy of all our models,we validate them against disk drive and RAID device measurements throughout.

=520  3\$aMULTI -hop wireless networks are usually defined as a collection of nodesequipped with radio transmitters, which not only have the capability tocommunicate each other in a multi-hop fashion, but also to route each others? datapackets. The distributed nature of such networks makes them suitable for a variety ofapplications where there are no assumed reliable central entities, or controllers, andmay significantly improve the scalability issues of conventional single-hop wirelessnetworks. This Ph. D. dissertation mainly investigates two aspects of the research issuesrelated to the efficient multi-hop wireless networks design, namely: (a) networkprotocols and (b) network management, both in cross-layer design paradigms toensure the notion of service quality, such as quality of service (QoS) in wireless meshnetworks (WMNs) for backhaul applications and quality of information (QoI) inwireless sensor networks (WSNs) for sensing tasks. Throughout the presentation ofthis Ph. D. dissertation, different network settings are used as illustrative examples,however the proposed algorithms, methodologies, protocols, and models are notrestricted in the considered networks, but rather have wide applicability. First, this dissertation proposes a cross-layer design framework integratinga distributed proportional-fair scheduler and a QoS routing algorithm, while usingWMNs as an illustrative example. The proposed approach has significant performancegain compared with other network protocols. Second, this dissertation proposesa generic admission control methodology for any packet network, wired andwireless, by modeling the network as a black box, and using a generic mathematical0. Abstract 3function and Taylor expansion to capture the admission impact. Third, this dissertationfurther enhances the previous designs by proposing a negotiation process,to bridge the applications? service quality demands and the resource management,while using WSNs as an illustrative example. This approach allows the negotiationamong different service classes and WSN resource allocations to reach the optimaloperational status. Finally, the guarantees of the service quality are extended tothe environment of multiple, disconnected, mobile subnetworks, where the questionof how to maintain communications using dynamically controlled, unmanned dataferries is investigated.

=520  3\$aIn this dissertation we propose four methods for the recognition of human activities. In all four ofthem, the representation of the activities is based on spatiotemporal features that are automaticallydetected at areas where there is a significant amount of independent motion, that is, motion that isdue to ongoing activities in the scene. We propose the use of spatiotemporal salient points as featuresthroughout this dissertation. The algorithms presented, however, can be used with any kind of features,as long as the latter are well localized and have a well-defined area of support in space and time. Weintroduce the utilized spatiotemporal salient points in the first method presented in this dissertation. By extending previous work on spatial saliency, we measure the variations in the information content ofpixel neighborhoods both in space and time, and detect the points at the locations and scales for whichthis information content is locally maximized. In this way, an activity is represented as a collection ofspatiotemporal salient points. We propose an iterative linear space-time warping technique in orderto align the representations in space and time and propose to use Relevance Vector Machines (RVM)in order to classify each example into an action category. In the second method proposed in thisdissertation we propose to enhance the acquired representations of the first method. More specifically,we propose to track each detected point in time, and create representations based on sets of trajectories,where each trajectory expresses how the information engulfed by each salient point evolves over time. In order to deal with imperfect localization of the detected points, we augment the observation modelof the tracker with background information, acquired using a fully automatic background estimationalgorithm. In this way, the tracker favors solutions that contain a large number of foreground pixels. In addition, we perform experiments where the tracked templates are localized on specific parts of thebody, like the hands and the head, and we further augment the tracker?s observation model using ahuman skin color model. Finally, we use a variant of the Longest Common Subsequence algorithm(LCSS) in order to acquire a similarity measure between the resulting trajectory representations, andRVMs for classification. In the third method that we propose, we assume that neighboring salientpoints follow a similar motion. This is in contrast to the previous method, where each salient point wastracked independently of its neighbors. More specifically, we propose to extract a novel set of visualdescriptors that are based on geometrical properties of three-dimensional piece-wise polynomials. Thelatter are fitted on the spatiotemporal locations of salient points that fall within local spatiotemporalneighborhoods, and are assumed to follow a similar motion. The extracted descriptors are invariant intranslation and scaling in space-time. Coupling the neighborhood dimensions to the scale at which thecorresponding spatiotemporal salient points are detected ensures the latter. The descriptors that areextracted across the whole dataset are subsequently clustered in order to create a codebook, which isused in order to represent the overall motion of the subjects within small temporal windows. Finally,we use boosting in order to select the most discriminative of these windows for each class, and RVMs forclassification. The fourth and last method addresses the joint problem of localization and recognitionof human activities depicted in unsegmented image sequences. Its main contribution is the use of animplicit representation of the spatiotemporal shape of the activity, which relies on the spatiotemporallocalization of characteristic ensembles of spatiotemporal features. The latter are localized aroundautomatically detected salient points. Evidence for the spatiotemporal localization of the activityis accumulated in a probabilistic spatiotemporal voting scheme. During training, we use boosting inorder to create codebooks of characteristic feature ensembles for each class. Subsequently, we constructclass-specific spatiotemporal models, which encode where in space and time each codeword ensembleappears in the training set. During testing, each activated codeword ensemble casts probabilisticvotes concerning the spatiotemporal localization of the activity, according to the information storedduring training. We use a Mean Shift Mode estimation algorithm in order to extract the most probablehypotheses from each resulting voting space. Each hypothesis corresponds to a spatiotemporal volumewhich potentially engulfs the activity, and is verified by performing action category classification withan RVM classifier.

=520  3\$aThe insecticide synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), has been used to reduce resistance factors and to characterise metabolic resistance resulting from mixed function oxidases (MFOs). Studies have also shown that PBO can interact with resistance-associated esterases. It is well-documented that the mechanism by which PBO inhibits P450s is the interaction of the methylenedioxyphenyl (MDP) moiety of PBO molecule with the haem moiety of the enzyme. To investigate the interactions between PBO and esterases, a structure activity relationship (SAR) study was carried out using analogues of PBO and E4, a resistance associated esterase from the peach-potato aphid Myzus persicae. Results indicate that the polyether and the alkyl chain were fundamentally important in this interaction. Removing one oxygen atom from the MDP moiety of PBO did not affect the binding affinity, but increased affinities resulted from the replacement of the polyether with an alkynyl ether chain or by increasing the length of the alkyl chain. An analogue, EN 16/5-1, that retains the ability to interact with esterases but loses the ability to act on P450s, due to a modification to the MDP moiety, was used in conjunction with PBO to facilitate characterisation of metabolic resistance in M. persicae and pollen beetle Meligethes aeneus. Selected analogues of PBO containing the alkynyl ether side chain exhibited high synergistic effects in vivo and were found to be potent inhibitors of O-deethylation of 7-ethoxycoumarin when tested against pyrethroid resistant M. aeneus. The capability of some of the analogues to act as insecticide synergists was investigated in vivo against two M. persicae clones possessing different metabolic resistance profiles. Finally, the potential of PBO analogues to provide potent and/or specific synergism to overcome insecticide resistance and reduce insecticide titre applied to crops is considered.

=520  3\$aThis thesis is concerned with the characterization of layered contact problems. The research projecthas been prompted by an investigation into creep, and ultimately, gross sliding, of rubber tyresfitted around steel wheels in earth moving equipment. In general, slippage between tyre and rimis experienced in common engineering applications employing tyred systems. A general and systematicapproach for investigating the interfacial behaviour of tyred systems has consequently beenproposed. Classical techniques together with novel numerical approaches based on advanced mathematicalprogramming have been implemented to support the investigation. Creep between matingsurfaces, frictional shakedown and measuring friction in partial slip condition are the main objectsof investigation. The analytical and numerical models developed by the author have been complementedby experimental work, whose detailed description is also included in this thesis. Finally,further studies have been performed to shed light on some of the design issues offered by the threedimensionalfull-scale engineering application. The numerical approach based on finite elementmodelling used to tackle these aspects of the project and the experimental work carried out by theauthor to corroborate the numerical findings are also presented.

=520  3\$aModels of whole-brain connectivity are valuable for understanding neurological function. This thesis seeks to develop an optimal framework for extracting models of whole-brain connectivity from clinically-acquired diffusion data. We propose new approaches for studying these models. The aim is to develop techniques which can take models of brain connectivity and use them to identify biomarkers or phenotypes of disease. The models of connectivity are extracted using a standard probabilistic tractography algorithm, modified to assess the structural integrity of tracts, through estimates of white matter anisotropy. Connections are traced between 77 regions of interest, automatically extracted by label propagation from multiple brain atlases followed by classifier fusion. The estimates of tissue integrity for each tractare input as indices in 77x77 'connectivity' matrices, extracted for large populations of clinical data. These are compared in subsequent studies. To date, most whole-brain connectivity studies have characterised population differences using graph theory techniques. However these can be limited in their ability to pinpoint the locations of differences in the underlying neural anatomy. Therefore, this thesis proposes new techniques. These include a spectral clustering approach for comparing population differences in the clustering properties of weighted brain networks. In addition, machine learning approaches are suggested for the first time. These are particularly advantageous as they allow classification of subjects and extraction of features which best represent the differences between groups. One limitation of the proposed approach is that errors propagate from segmentation and registration steps prior to tractography. This can cumulate in the assignment of false positive connections, where the contribution of these factors may vary across populations, causing the appearance of population differences where there are none. The final contribution of this thesis is therefore to develop a common co-ordinate space approach. This combines probabilistic models of voxel-wise diffusion for each subject into a single probabilistic model of diffusion for the population. This allows tractography to be performed only once, ensuring that there is one model of connectivity. Cross-subject differences can then be identified by mapping individual subjects' anisotropy data to this model. The approach is used to compare populations separated by age and gender.

=520  3\$aMechanical ventilation, essential for the support of patients with acute lung injury (ALI), causes exacerbation of the existing pathology, a process termed ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). The pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) has been consistently implicated in ALI/VILI. TNF activates two receptors, TNFR p55 and p75 that act in opposition during VILI to promote or protect against pulmonary oedema formation, respectively, but the mechanisms underlying this are unknown. Alveolar and plasma soluble TNFR (sTNFR) levels are elevated in ventilated ALI patients and associated with mortality. However, the relevance of these increases is unclear. This project had two main aims: to investigate kinetics and sources of sTNFRs in the alveoli and plasma and investigate mechanisms underlying differential TNFR signalling during VILI, using in vivo mouse models. Investigation of intraalveolar sTNFRs during VILI, and also ALI induced by intratracheal administration of hydrochloric acid or bacterial toxins, showed that intraalveolar sTNFRs are differentially regulated during ALI: VILI/hydrochloric acid induced leakage of sTNFR p55 and p75 from plasma, whereas bacterial toxins induced intraalveolar p75 production. These differences have important implications for TNF signalling and potential use as clinical markers. Investigation of plasma sTNFRs suggests that VILI induces direct production of sTNFRs by the pulmonary vasculature, as opposed to leakage of intraalveolar sTNFRs into the circulation as previously suggested. Development of a flow cytometry technique to study pulmonary TNFR expression was successfully validated using TNFR deficient tissue, but consolidation of data by immunohistochemistry was unsuccessful. Investigation of differential TNFR signalling mechanisms showed that following intratracheal fluid administration, p75 deficient mice exhibit physiological changes consistent with impaired fluid reabsorption, implicating p75 in lung fluid reabsorption during VILI. These data offer new, potentially clinically applicable insights into the involvement of TNFR biology in VILI/ALI and the novel methodologies developed herein constitute useful tools for future research.

=520  3\$aThe extracellular domain of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognises highly specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns in innate immunity. This causes molecular rearrangement of the intracellular Toll/Interleukin-1 (TIR) domains of the TLRs allowing recruitment of downstream adaptor proteins via heterotypic TIR-TIR protein interactions. This in turn initiates a signalling cascade leading to proinflammatory immune responses. Recent work has indicated that TIR-like proteins (TLPs)from pathogenic bacteria contain TIR domains and interfere with host TLR signalling. Bacterial TLPs are suggested to bind to the TIR domains of host TLRs and/or adaptor proteins, thereby inhibiting intracellular signalling. This project focuses on characterisation of the TLPs from the highly pathogenic bacteria Yersinia pestis (YpTLP) and Burkholderia pseudomallei (BpTLP). The aim of the project was to produce soluble, pure and stable TLPs of yields suitable for functional and structural studies. Bacterial TLPs were expressed in E. coli. Expression of the full-length YpTLP and BpTLP using pWaldo-GFPe yielded 2.78 mg/l and 2.52 mg/l respectively. Protein purification steps were complicated by protein precipitation, possible degradation and misfolding. Subsequent efforts focused on the expression of the TIR only domain/homologue regions: YpTIR and BpTIR. Soluble YpTIR and BpTIR were expressed using pET26b. GST pull down assays indicated positive interactions between His-tagged YpTIR/BpTIR and GST-tagged human MyD88-TIR, a major adaptor protein, revealing MyD88 as a potential target of the bacterial TLPs. However expression yields of pure protein were too low to allow further studies. YpTIR and BpTIR were then expressed as fusions with an N-terminal GB1 tag using GEV2. Subsequent purification produced highly pure GB1-YpTIR (5 mg/l). NMR analysis indicated that the protein was folded and likely to be in a dimeric form, a finding confirmed by gel filtration. Native and derivative crystals of YpTIR were obtained, and native diffraction datasets collected to 2.95 A. Further work includes obtaining the phase information. It is anticipated that the crystal structure of YpTIR will provide insight into the molecular basis of TIR signalling and evidence of evolutionary conservation among TIR domains.

=520  3\$aOne of the fundamental goals in neuroscience is to understand how the diverse types of neurons are generated by stem and progenitor cells in the vertebrate central nervous system. To understand the mechanism that underlies this process, a greater knowledge of the molecular control of the acquisition of neuronal identity is still required. This knowledge is not only important for understanding of normal central nervous system development, but is also key to uncovering the mechanisms of neurological diseases. In the last decades a great progress in the in vivo studies has been made, thus enabling for generation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in vitro. There are a few signalling molecules and growth factors known to be involved in the progression of NPCs to neurons in vitro and in vivo, which act as components of signalling pathways such as Notch, Shh and Wnt. Role of Notch pathway is however the best characterised. In this thesis a role for protein that belongs to the family of Notch receptors and ligands, called Delta like 1-homologue (DLK1), in neuronal differentiation of ESCs-derived NPCs was investigated. Firstly time course of DLK1 expression during in vitro neuronal differentiation of mouse ESCs and in the developing mouse brain was examined. The results indicated that the expression of DLK1 is associated with neuronal differentiation. Following that the effect of DLK1 on the differentiation and proliferation of hESCs and mESCs-derived NPCs was tested. Induction of DLK1 in mNPCs, by making use of CreERT2 system, as well exposure of hNPCs to the molecule resulted in positive modulation of the number of differentiated neurons. Moreover DLK1 did not seem to have any effect on cell proliferation. Lastly to address a question whether DLK1 acts through Notch pathway, Hes1 luciferase assay was applied. The data showed that DLK1 negatively regulates Hes1 luciferase activity in mNPCs and hNPCs. Downregulation of Hes1 transcript was further confirmed by qPCR. Taken together studies described in this thesis propose a novel function for DLK1 as one of the molecules involved in the complex cascade of factors modulating neuronal differentiation.

=520  3\$aTo date, the stability of inverse bicontinuous cubic phases and the mechanism of lamellar to cubictransitions are poorly understood due to limited experimental resolution and reproducibility. Systematic experimental data is imperative for reasonable testing and verification of establishedtheoretical models in this area. This thesis focuses on two aspects of lyotropic phase behaviour;the equilibrium behaviour of lyotropic liquid crystalline phases and the transitions between theequilibrium states. When monolinolein (ML) is mixed with water it forms a variety of inverse lyotropic phases, forexample the lamellar, inverse bicontinuous phases (QIIG and QIID) and the inverse hexagonal phase(HII) which makes this lipid an ideal candidate for study of these phases. The monolinoleinequilibrium phase behaviour has been characterised as a function of pressure, temperature andhydration using SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering) and the data used to verify the existence of thepivotal surface in the QIIG phase. Knowing the location of the pivotal surface allows one to calculatethe total energy of these structures. The second part of this thesis discusses the kinetics of the lamellar to QIIG transition in monolinoleinunder limited hydration conditions using the pressure jump time resolved X-ray diffractiontechnique. Lamellar to inverse bicontinuous cubic phase transitions are relevant to fundamentalcellular processes such as membrane fusion and fission due to structural similarities of themechanisms. The sequence of structural changes observed from kinetic experiments are discussedin relation to the Stalk Mechanism and the data analysed using a quantitative model.

=520  3\$aThe femur is the longest bone in the human body and serves the important purposes of load-bearing and allowing bipedal locomotion. Accurate modelling of the variation in shape within the healthy adult population can be useful for a variety of applications - from the mere anatomical description of its features, in order to better understand its function, to more complex tasks such as pathology detection or surgical planning. Statistical Shape Modelling (SSM) is a well-established technique that enables to capture the variability within a set of training shapes and describes it with a reduced set of variables. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the performance of a SSM based on a point cloud representation of shape, and introduce and test subsequent improvements to the modelling process that can increase its clinical relevance and scope of application. The standard approach to SSM employs a dimension-reducing technique, generally by means of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). However, this approach favours the compactness of the model, thus not focusing on other aspects that may be more relevant to clinical practice. Although rotation of the principal components is commonly performed as a post-processing step in statistical analysis involving PCA, it is not routinely applied in SSM. By applying this class of rotation, the components' effects are more localised, allowing a better interpretation, understanding and classification of pathological deformities. Among other possible representations, the Medial Axis Transform (MAT) could offer a further insight into shape modelling, since it allows the information about thickness to be decoupled from the rest of the shape. SSMs based on this representation can lead to a different perspective on the understanding of femoral anatomy and function,and can also enable the reconstruction of the complete anatomy starting from a reduced set of features, with diverse applications in the fields of surgical planning, forensic science and paleontology.

=520  3\$aIn most real-world acoustical scenarios, speech signals captured by distant microphones from a source are reverberated due to multipath propagation, and the reverberation may impair speech intelligibility. Speech dereverberation can be achievedby equalizing the channels from the source to microphones. Equalization systems canbe computed using estimates of multichannel acoustic impulse responses. However,the estimates obtained from system identification always include errors; the fact thatan equalization system is able to equalize the estimated multichannel acoustic system does not mean that it is able to equalize the true system. The objective of thisthesis is to propose and investigate robust equalization methods for multichannelacoustic systems in the presence of system identification errors. Equalization systems can be computed using the multiple-input/output inverse theorem or multichannel least-squares method. However, equalization systemsobtained from these methods are very sensitive to system identification errors. Astudy of the multichannel least-squares method with respect to two classes of characteristic channel zeros is conducted. Accordingly, a relaxed multichannel least-squares method is proposed. Channel shortening in connection with the multiple-input/output inverse theorem and the relaxed multichannel least-squares method isdiscussed. Two algorithms taking into account the system identification errors are developed. Firstly, an optimally-stopped weighted conjugate gradient algorithm isproposed. A conjugate gradient iterative method is employed to compute the equalization system. The iteration process is stopped optimally with respect to system identification errors. Secondly, a system-identification-error-robust equalizationmethod exploring the use of error models is presented, which incorporates systemidentification error models in the weighted multichannel least-squares formulation.

=520  3\$aBone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 signalling via BMPR1A is required for themaintenance of the epiblast in the early embryo, and for self-renewal of pluripotentmouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by inhibiting neural differentiation. In this study, theself-renewal and differentiation abilities of ES cells lacking BMPR1A wereinvestigated. Bmpr1a-null ES cells did not respond to BMP4 but retained a degree ofSMAD1/5/8 activation and Id1 expression. This activation was likely due to BMP7signalling via ACVR1. The observation that Bmpr1a-/- ES cells showed no selfrenewalor pluripotency defects suggested that signalling by BMPs of the 60asubgroup (such as BMP7) can also maintain pluripotency. When Bmpr1a-/- ES cellswere differentiated, although they did form derivatives of the three germ layers, theydisplayed a higher propensity to undergo neurectodermal specification than controlcells, likely due to their lower levels of BMP signalling. Cell Competition is the process by which viable cells are eliminated in the presenceof metabolically more active or fitter cells. In Drosophila this process depends ondMyc levels and on limiting amounts of the survival factor Decapentaplegic(homologous to the mammalian BMPs). When Bmpr1a-/- ES cells were co-culturedwith wild-type cells, they gradually disappeared from the culture and were thereforeout-competed. This cell competition was enhanced by limiting the amounts ofsurvival and growth factors and could be rescued by restoring BMP4 signalling inBmpr1a-/- cells. In co-culture, Bmpr1a-/- ES cells showed no significant changes inapoptosis but had a decreased cell cycle rate and increased levels of differentiation. Concomitantly, higher c-MYC levels were observed in wild-type cells due toincreased protein stability. The out-competition of Bmpr1a-/- cells was dependent on differentiation as it could be prevented by inhibiting this process. These resultssuggest that during development cell competition may be an important mechanismcontrolling cell fate and survival.

=520  3\$aThis research utilised qualitative methods to gain a deeper insight into the policy, planning and practice of school-based drug education than had previously been achieved in Scotland. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with staff in nine Grampian secondary schools together with a case study of one school. The case study involved direct lesson observations as well as in-depth interviews and feedback sessions with stakeholders in drug education including staff and 48 pupils. In both parts of the study schools were selected by theoretical sampling, each interview was transcribed in full and all data were annotated and analysed with the aid of specialist computer software. Validity and reliability were enhanced by constant vigilance in data analysis and by various procedures including reactivity analysis, peer examination, triangulation and consideration of any potential bias on the part of the researcher. The highest standards of ethics were applied throughout the study. Whereas previous studies have revealed the lack of impact of drug education on drug-taking behaviour in young people, this research is unique in attempting to explain this lack of impact. The research findings revealed that teaching and learning processes in drug education were below best practice as defined by the relevant research literature and national guidelines. Four key underlying issues were identified: (1) A lack of clarity and understanding about the goals of drug education; (2) A lack of time and support for researching, planning and reviewing drug education; (3) A low priority assigned to Personal and Social Education (PSE) in general; (4) A failure to recognise drug education as a broad and complex subject requiring considerable expertise to teach. Fundamental changes to how drug education is approached both locally and nationally would be required to resolve these issues in full. Ihe nature of these changes is discussed in detail in the thesis.

The project establishes a critical dialogue between university-based Film Studies and the archive sector, via a series of case studies of influential groups, individuals, and movements. Prefaced by a chapter entitled ?Theorising Amateur Film: Limitations and Possibilities? detailing the domination of amateur cinema studies by discussion of the ?home mode?, I suggest that work to date has obscured an understanding of films made by cine-clubs within the highly organised film culture of British amateur cine movement. The main body of the thesis consists of four chapters exploring the most popular generic practices of ?institutionalised? amateur filmmakers, focusing on: art cinema, the ?film play?, community filmmaking, and the amateur heritage picture. I argue that these production strands were formed by discourses circulating within amateur film journals, ?how to do it? manuals and amateur film festivals. Amateur cinema was viewed throughout as a parallel cine movement existing alongside professional practices, enjoying an ambivalent relationship to inherited professional standards. The final chapter, ?Amateur Film Re-Located?, proposes a fresh theorisation of ?local? amateur production within a national film culture, marked by distinctly cosmopolitan connections.

=520  3\$aThis thesis focuses on perceptions of workmanship in the English porcelain and earthenware industries between 1760 and 1800. Research by Berg and Clifford has demonstrated a new interest in and valuation of workmanship by contemporaries in the eighteenth century. Yet little is known of what contemporaries understood workmanship to mean, or be. This thesis argues that understandings of workmanship affected both the consumption and production practices of eighteenth-century contemporaries. It does so by concentrating on six groups of people ? industrial tourists, consumers, retailers, designers, manufacturers and workers. It demonstrates the different ways in which contemporaries perceived hand skills and tacit knowledge by examining a range of sources such as letters, prints, trade cards, travel accounts and objects. This thesis concludes that meanings of ?workmanship? - that combination of effort, work and skill - were shifting in the second half of the eighteenth century. For those not employed in manufacturing, reading manuals, seeing production in action and handling objects all challenged their ideas of workmanship. These experiences encouraged contemporaries to question the meaning of innovative products and the manufacturing techniques used to make them. Similarly, in manufacturing the development of the design process and the demands of novelty and standardisation forced manufacturers, designers and modellers to ask how to achieve ?excellent workmanship?. At the same time, workers understood and valued their work in different terms ? as a hard-won, social and physical skill. This thesis argues that for eighteenth-century contemporaries ?workmanship? was a complex idea, under challenge from developments in production and consumption. In so doing it moves the interlinked history of manufacturing and consumption away from the extant debates of economic historians and into a different sub-disciplinary space, namely cultural history; a space that has tended to neglect the cultural aspects of production.

=520  3\$aThe main purpose of this research was to explore the reasons why some schools are successful in pedagogical innovations in ICT integration, while others are less so. This research centres on two rural schools in Taiwan with different levels of sustainability of ICT implementation. In this research, ?School A? was identified as successfully sustaining pedagogical innovations in ICT integration; ?School B? was identified as not yet successfully sustaining pedagogical innovations in this regard. Questionnaires, interviews and documentary reviews were the research sources. The results confirmed a clear difference between School A and School B in their leadership approaches in the processes of implementing ICT. Leadership in School A was collaborative and proactive. Leadership in School B was limited to ICT experts and formal leaders. Moreover, compared with ICT resources and training, perceived compatibility of the ICT-integrated pedagogy and informal learning had a greater impact on teachers? persistence of ICT integration. Finally, compared with parents? support and cross-school learning, the governmental support was found to be more influential to ICT implementation in school settings. Currently, there is still limited research examining ICT implementation in Taiwanese rural schools. This study could serve as a reference for further research in this regard.

=520  3\$aShar??ah governance is peculiarly exclusive and unique to Islamic systems of financial management. While affirming the need for sound and efficient Shar??ah governance as a crucial part of corporate governance in Islamic financial institutions (IFIs), it has nevertheless been found that little has been written on the subject. In view of the scarcity of literature and specific studies in this area, this study aims to explore the state of Shar??ah governance practices in IFIs, particularly in Malaysia, GCC countries (Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Saudi Arabia) and the UK, as these countries present distinctive models and approaches towards Shar??ah governance in diverse legal environments. This study explores and analyses the extent of Shar??ah governance practices by highlighting seven main areas of Shar??ah governance: (i) Shar??ah governance approaches; (ii) regulatory frameworks and by-laws; (iii) roles of Shar??ah boards; (iv) attributes of Shar??ah boards in terms of independence, competence, transparency and confidentiality; (v) operational procedures; (vi) Shar??ah board assessment; and (vii) disclosure practice. Since the availability of data and information on Shar??ah governance practices is very limited, a detailed questionnaire was generated for the sourcing of primary data from IFIs. As part of the qualitative research strategy, semi-structured interviews were conducted with Shar??ah scholars, specifically to explore their perceptions on selected Shar??ah governance issues. In addition, the content analysis approach was used in extracting and analysing the data and factual input derived from information and resources on IFIs? websites, exchange websites, annual reports and financial statements. The findings in this study interestingly reveal that there are shortcomings and weaknesses in the present practice of Shar??ah governance in all seven core areas mentioned above. Based on the empirical analysis extracted from the research findings, the study finally offers and formulates some policy recommendations for the purpose of enhancing and improving the present Shar??ah governance system.
