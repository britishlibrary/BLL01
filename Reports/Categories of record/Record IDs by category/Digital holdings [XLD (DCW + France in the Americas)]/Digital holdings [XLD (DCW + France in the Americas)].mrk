=500  \\$aDate range attributed because WorldCat lists one map with the same title as this map that is attributed to Gédéon de Catalogne and is dated 1708.

However, neither the British Library nor British Museum catalogues seem to make reference to Gédéon de Catalogne for this item.
=500  \\$aFive fortified locations are depicted pictorially on the map; Québec, Trois-Rivières, an un-named fort at the head of the River Saint François River, a subsequent fort further south along the same river named "Fort des Sauvages Abenaquis", and a fifth fort named "Sauvages Abenaquis" on what is now the River Becancour.
=500  \\$aThe map has previously been dated [1750] in the British Library catalogue.

The symbols bear similarities to those used on Herman Moll's map of the region to identify additional villages (and their ownership - French, English or "Savage"), forts, beaver hunting, land carriages and other features.
=500  \\$aFull text beneath map reads "In our present Course of Proceeding in America, as conceived, it is impossible to bring the War to a happy Close, or to gain the Indians over to our Interests, unless we break the Communications of the French Settlements, which may be done by BUILDING a strong Fort at the mouth of the River Condé; a Second on the South Side of the Lake Huron; and a third at the River des Francois; but it will be proper to begin with building a fort at the River Condé & to have several Rowboats of Force to command the Navigation of the Lake Ossie, which has a Communication with the Lake Huron, & by means of these Boats we may build the Forts on the North & South Sides of the Lake Huron, & also supply the Garrisons with all manner of Necessary in Summer. The aforesaid Forts & Row Gallies built on the Lake Ossie & Huron may command the whole of the Indian Trade, & render the French Settlements of little or no service to them."
=500  \\$aIn dating the map it is noted that Fort Oswego is not shown on the map - the battle of Fort Oswego took place in August 1756 after which the fort was effectively abandoned until 1758. However, Fort Kaminisitquia is named on the map, which was abandoned with the fall of New France.
=500  \\$aThe map bears a number of similarities with Hermann Moll's English edition of Lahontan's (Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce, Baron de la Hontan) map entitled 'A General Map of New France Com.call'd Canada' that was published in 1703 and 1735 in English editions of Lahontan's voyages. See Kershaw, Kenneth A., Early printed maps of Canada I. 1540-1703, entry 296.
=500  \\$aThe map identifies forts at "Chambli", "Frontenac", "Niagara", "La Salle", "Crevecoeur", "Kamanistigoyan" and "Port Nelson", and also shows the "Little Fort of St Germain" and two English forts at the south end of James Bay.

=500  \\$aA date of about 1740 to about 1749 is suggested for this map as it does not name Halifax, which was founded by the British in 1749. The map is certainly later than 1710 when Port Royal was captured by the British and renamed Annapolis (as shown on the map). A date in the 1740s seems a possibility on both stylistic grounds and with consideration of the ongoing King George's War (1744 to 1748). The focus on 'Acadie' by the French mapmaker (and the partial mapping of Cape Breton, already held by the French) could suggest that Acadie was under French scrutiny again.
